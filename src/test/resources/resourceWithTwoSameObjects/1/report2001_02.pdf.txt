Preface 
This report is a new volume in the series "GlaciologicaI investigations in Norway" 
which has been published since 1963. 
The report is based on a number of reports about different investigations of 
Norwegian glaciers. Measurements of mass balance, front position change and 
volume change and other glaciological investigations are presented. 
Most of the investigations are ordered by extemal employers and published earlier as 
reports to these. 
The report is now published only in English with aminor summary in Norwegian. 
The purpose of this report is to provide a joint presentation of the investigations and 
calculations made mainly by NVE, Glacier and Snow section during 2000. Even 
though the chapters are written by different authors with different objectives, it is 
aimed at obtaining a uniform pattern. The authors had the professional responsibility 
for the content of each chapter. The fieldwork and the calculations are mainly aresult 
of co-operative work amongst the employees at Glacier and Snow section. 
Bjarne Kjøllmoen was editor and Miriam Jackson made many corrections and 
improvements .

Summary 
Mass balanee investigations were performed on fourteen glaciers in Norway in the 
year 2000. Eleven of these glaeiers are in southern Norway and three in northern 
Norway. 
The winter balanee was higher than average for all the study glaeiers in southern 
Norway. Ålfotbreen had the highest winter balanee compared to usual with 149 % 
(5.6 m w.eqv.) of the mean value, which is the sec ond highest winter balanee ever 
measured since measurements began in 1963. For the 1989/90 winter season the value 
was 6.0 m w.eqv. In northern Norway, Engabreen had less than average (91 %), while 
Langfjordjøkelen had more than the mean value (113 %). 
The summer balanee was lower than average on all the study glaeiers with the 
exception of Ålfotbreen. Engabreen had the lowest comparative summer balanee with 
56 % of average. This result (-1.3 m w.eqv.) is the sec ond lowest (e.f. -1.2 min 1977) 
ever measured on Engabreen since measurements began in 1970. 
The final results show a positive net balanee for nine of the ten glaeiers in southern 
Norway. Ålfotbreen (2.0 m w.eqv.), Nigardsbreen (1.7 m w.eqv.) and Engabreen 
(1.5 m w.eqv.) had the greatest surplus. Only Langfjordjøkelen had a significant 
deficit (-0.6 m w.eqv.). 
Front position measurements were perforrned for 24 Norwegian glaeiers in 2000. 
Twenty of the glaciers are in southem Norway and four in northem Norway. The 
results show a frontal retreat for the southern and western outlets of Jostedalsbreen 
during the period from autumn 1999 to autumn 2000. Briksdalsbreen had a marked 
retreat with 30 metres. Glacier outlets on the eastern side, however, continued the 
previous years' advance. Nigardsbreen and Fåbergstøisbreen had the greatest advance 
with 23 and 25 metres, respectively, during this one-year period. Frontal advance was 
also measured at two outlets from Hardangerjøkulen; Rembesdalskåka (21 m) and 
Midtdalsbreen (8 m). Measurements from Folgefonna show that Bondhusbrea had a 
retreat of 24 m during this time. In Jotunheimen the front position changes are small, 
some outlets have had a slight advance, while other outlets have had a negligible 
retreat. Measurements at four glaeiers in northern Norway showaslight retreat. 
Digital terrain models have been used to calculate vol urne changes for two glaeiers in 
northern Norway and four glaeiers in southern Norway. The interval between 
mappings is different for each glacier. Most of the outlets from Hardangerjøkulen 
have increased in volurne during the period 1961-95. Tverråbreen and Hellstugubreen 
in Jotunheimen show a marked loss in volurne from 1968 to 1997. In northern 
Norway, both Høgtuvbreen in Nordland and StrupbreeniKoppangsbreen in Troms had 
a considerable decrease in volurne from the 1970's to 1998.

Sammendrag 
12000 ble det utført massebalansemålinger på 14 breer i Norge - Il i SØr-Norge og 
tre i Nord-Norge. 
På alle de målte breene i Sør-Norge ble vinterbalansen større enn middelverdiene. 
Sammenlignet med breens gjennomsnitt hadde Ålfotbreen størst vinterbalanse med 
149 % (5.6 m vannekvivalenter) av middelverdien. Siden målingene startet i 1963 er 
det målt større vinterbalanse bare en gang tidligere - 6,0 m i 1990. I Nord-Norge ble 
resultatet noe mindre enn middelverdien på Engabreen (91 %) og litt over 
gjennomsnittet på Langfjordjøkelen (113 %). 
Sommerbalansen ble mindre enn gjennomsnittet på alle de målte breene i landet med 
unntak av Ålfotbreen. Engabreen hadde relativt minst sommerbalanse med 56 % av 
gjennomsnittet. Dette resultatet (-1,3 m) er den nest laveste sommerbalansen (-1,2 mi 
1977) som er målt på Engabreen siden målingene startet i 1970. 
En nedbørrik vinter og relativt kjølig sommer resulterte dermed i overskudd på de 
fleste breene det blir utført målinger. Størst overskudd ble det på Ålfotbreen med 2,0 
m, Nigardsbreen med 1,7 m og Engabreen med 1,5 m vannekvivalenter. Bare 
Langfjordjøkelen fikk et signifikant underskudd (-0,6 m). 
Frontmålinger ble utført på 24 norske breer i 2000, 20 i Sør-Norge og fire i Nord-
Norge. Resultatene viser at breutløperne på syd- og vestsiden av Jostedalsbreen har 
gått tilbake fra høsten 1999 til høsten 2000. Briksdalsbreen hadde i denne perioden en 
markert tilbakegang med 30 meter. På østsiden har derimot flere av utløperne fortsatt 
de siste åras framgang. Nigardsbreen og FåbergstøIsbreen gikk mest fram med hhv. 
23 og 25 m i denne ettårs perioden. Det ble også målt framgang på to utløpere fra 
Hardangerjøkulen; Rembesdalskåka (21 m) og Midtdalsbreen (8 m). Målinger fra 
Folgefonna viser at Bondhusbrea gikk tilbake 24 m i denne perioden. I Jotunheimen 
er endringene små og noen brefronter har gått fram, mens andre har trukket seg 
tilbake. Målinger på fire breer i Nord-Norge viser at alle har hatt en liten tilbakegang. 
Ved hjelp av digitale terrengmodeller er volumendringene i forskjellige tidsperioder 
beregnet for fire breer i Sør-Norge og to breer i Nord-Norge. På Hardangerjøkulen 
har de fleste utløperne økt i volum i perioden 1961-95. I Jotunheimen har både 
Tverråbreen og Hellstugubreen hatt markerte volumtap i perioden 1968-97. I Nord-
Norge hadde både Høgtuvbreen i Nordland og StrupbreeniKoppangsbreen i Troms 
betydelige reduksjoner i brevolum fra 1970-tallet og fram til 1998.

1 Glaeier investigations in 
Norway in 2000 
1.1 Mass balanee 
Studies of mass balanee include measurements of accumulated snow (winter balance) 
during the winter season, and measurements of snow and ice removed by melting 
(summer balanee ) during the summer season. The difference between these two 
parameters gives the net balance. If the winter balanee is greater than the summer 
balance, the net balanee is positive and the glaeier will increase in volume. 
Alternatively, if the melting of snow and ice during the summer is larger than the 
winter balance, the net balanee is negative and the ice volume will decrease. 
Method 
The method used to measure mass balanee is the same as used in previous years. 
From the experience gained of many years of measurements, the measurement 
network was reduced on individual glaeiers at the beginning of the 1990s, without 
affecting the accuracy of the resulting balanee ca1culations and the final results. 
The winter balanee is normally measured in April or May by probing to the previous 
year' s summer surface along the same profile each year. Stake readings are used to 
verify the probings in certain areas, where possible. Sinee the stakes can disappear 
during particularly snow-rich winters, and since it is of ten difficult to distinguish the 
summer surface (S.S.) by probing alone, snow coring is also used to eonfirm the 
probing results. Snow density is measured in pits at one or two loeations at different 
elevations on each glaeier. 
Summer and net balances are obtained from stake measurements, usually earried out 
in September or October. Below the glaeier's equilibrium line the net balanee is 
always negative, meaning that more snow and iee melts during a given summer than 
aecumulates during the winter. Above the equilibrium line, in the aceumulation area, 
the net balanee is always positive. Based on past experienee snow dens it y of the 
remaining snow in the accumulation area is typieally assumed to be 0.60 g/em3• After 
espeeially cold summers, or if there is more snow than usual remaining at the end of 
the summer, snow density is measured using snow-eores, or is assumed to be 
0.65 g/em3• The density of melted older firn is assumed to be between 0.65 and 
0.75 glem'. The density ofmelted iee is determined to be 0.90 g/em3• 
The mass balanee is calculated using the so-ealled stratigraphie or "traditional 
method" (Østrem and Brugman 1991). The balanee is ca1culated between two 
succes sive "summer surfaces" (i.e. surface minima). 
The accuraey of the mass balanee measurements depends on severai factors. The 
accuraey of the winter balanee is influenced mainly by the accuracy of the point 
measurements (soundings, eore drillings, stakes and towers and density pit) and how 
7 
representative the y are. The evenness of the snow layer is also of importance. The 
accuracy of soundings and core drillings is dependent on the number of point 
measurements, the certainty of identifying the summer surface and the 
implementation of the measurements (e.g. if the probe penetrates vertically through 
the snow pack). Overall, the accuracy of winter balanee increases with increasing 
snow depth. 
The accuracy of summer balanee is primarily dependent on the number of stakes at 
which melting is measured. Further, it will depend on the representativeness of the 
stakes and by the state of the stakes. Common sources of error that may occur are 
stakes sinking becoming slanted. 
The accuracy of the net balanee is dependent on those factors mentioned above. 
As the mass balance is measured and calculated it is very difficult to make a 
mathematical estimation of the accuracy because it is difficult to quantify the 
accuracy of the individual factors. Thus, the determined values of accuracy are based 
on a subjective estimate. 
Mass balanee program 
In 2000 mass balance measurements were performed on fourteen glaeiers in Norway-
eleven in southern Norway and three in northern Norway. In southern Norway, six of 
the glaeiers have been measured for 38 consecutive years or more. They constitute a 
west-east profile reaching from the very maritime Ålfotbreen glacier with a midd le 
winter balance of 3.7 m water equivalent, to the very continental Gråsubreen with a 
middle winter balance of 0.8 m w.eqv. Storbreen in Jotunheimen has the longest 
series of all glaeiers in Norway with 52 years of measurements, while Engabreen has 
the longest series (31 years) in northern Norway. Measurements were started on 
Midtdalsbreen in the Hardangerjøkulen ice cap and resumed on Storglombreen in 
western Svartisen in 2000. The location of the glaciers investigated is shown in 
Figure l-l. 
In the following chapters mass balance studies performed on Norwegian glaciers in 
2000 are reported. The numbers from the Norwegian Hydrological Unit System 
(REGINE) and from the World Qlacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) are given for 
each glacier in Table l-l. 
The mass balance (winter, summer and net balance) is given both in volume 
(m' water) and specific water equivalents for each 50 or 100 m height interval. The 
results are given in both tab les and diagrams. All diagrams have the same ratio 
between units on the x- and y-axes in order to make comparison straightforward. 
Finally, histograms showing the complete mass balance results for each glacier are 
presented.

Weather conditions and mass balanee results 
A relatively dry September and October in 1999 resulted in a late start for snow 
accumulation on glaciers in both northern and southern Norway. In December, 
however, the precipitation was higher than normal in southern Norway and in the 
coastal regions in West-Finnmark. With the exception of some areas in eastem 
Norway, there was a lot of precipitation at the beginning of 2000, also. In glacier 
areas in western Norway the precipitation was 200 % of normal in January and 
February. In some parts of northem Norway there was almost continuous snowfall 
from January to April with most precipitation during March. In general there was 
heavy snowfall over most of the country during winter 1999/2000. In the past century 
it is only during winter 1991/92 that there was more snow than winter 1999/2000 over 
much of western Norway. 
For the glaciers in western Norway winter balance was between 130 and 150 % of the 
mean values. Ålfotbreen had the highest winter balance compared to normal with 
149 % (5.6 m w.eqv.) of the mean value, which is the second highest winter balance 
ever measured since measurements began in 1963. For the winter season 1989/90 the 
value was 6.0 m w.eqv. For the glaciers in Jotunheimen winter balance was greater 
than usual. The result for Storbreen was as much as 141 % ofthe mean value for the 
9 
period 1949-99. Hellstugubreen and Gråsubreen had 112 and 115 % of the average 
winter balanee for the period 1962-99. In northern Norway, Engabreen had less 
(91 %) than average for the period 1970-99, whi1e Langfjordjøkelen in West-
Finnmark had more (113 %) than the mean value for the period 1989-99. 
In June, the first half of July and August the air temperature was lower than normal in 
the glaeier areas in both southern and northern Norway. The last half of July and 
September, however, was warmer than normal. AIso, October was unusually warm, 
temperature records showing it was the second warmest October month since 1867 
with a mean temperature 3-4 °C higher than normal. The mean temperature for the 
summer 2000 season was dose to mean temperature values over the whole country. 
The cool early summer caused only moderate melting and even severai snowfalls on 
glaeiers in June. Moderate melting combined with fresh snowfall in the beginning of 
the mel ting season resuIts in the albedo remaining high beyond the summer season. 
This effect decreases the amount of melting and even though September was warmer 
than usual, the net balanee was lower than the mean values for the majority of the 
glaeiers where measurements are carried out. Comparatively, Engabreen had the 
lowest summer balanee with 56 % of average. This result (-1.3 m w.eqv.) is the 
second lowest (-1.2 m in 1977) ever measured on Engabreen since measurements 
began in 1970. In southern Norway, Austdalsbreen (75 %) and Hardangerjøkulen 
(77 %) had the lowest summer balanee compared to normal. For most maritime 
glaeiers (Ålfotbreen and Hansebreen) the summer balanee was slightly higher than 
average. It is, however, necessary to emphasize that ablation was measured in the 
midd le of September for glaeiers in southern Norway, except Ålfotbreen and 
Hansebreen. As mentioned in the previous paragraph the last half of September and 
October were warmer than normal. Thus there may have been some melting after the 
ablation measurements were performed, and accordingly the absolute value in 
summer balanee should be higher. 
The final results show positive net balanee for ten of the eleven glaeiers in southern 
Norway. Ålfotbreen (2.0 m w.eqv.) and Nigardsbreen (1.7 m w.eqv.) had the greatest 
surplus. Only Gråsubreen had a negative net balanee «-O.l m w.eqv.). In northern 
Norway, there was a surplus at Engabreen (+1.5 m w.eqv.) and Storglombreen 
(+ 1.1 m w.eqv.), while Langfjordjøkelen had a significant deficit (-0.6 m w.eqv.). 
The results from the mass balanee measurements in Norway in 2000 are shown in 
Table l-l. Winter (bw,), summer (bs) and net balanee (bn) are given in meter water 
equivalents (m w.eqv.) smoothly distributed over the entire glaeier surface. The 
figures in the % of average column show the current results in percent of the average 
for the previous years with measurements (minimum 8 years of measurements). The 
net balanee results are compared with the mean net balanee in the same way. ELA is 
the equilibrium line altitude. 
Figure 1-2 gives a graphical presentation of the mass balanee results in southern 
Norway for 2000. The west-east gradient is evident for both winter and summer 
balance.

The cumulative net balance for some of the glaciers in southern Norway during the 
period 1963-2000 is shown in Figure 1-3. The maritime glaciers - Ålfotbreen, 
Nigardsbreen and Hardangerjøkulen - have increased in volume, whilst Storbreen and 
Gråsubreen in Jotunheimen showa distinct decrease in net balance. The considerable 
surplus for the maritime glaciers is a result of some high snowfall winter seasons over 
the last 12 years.

1.2 Other investigations 
Front position measurements were performed at 26 glaciers in Norway in 2000. Some 
of these have measurements going back to ca. 1900. As weU as being presented in a 
separate chapter (chap. 17), the front position changes are described for each glacier 
within that respective chapter. 
Volume calcu1ations based on map comparison are performed for seven glaciers. The 
results are presented in chapter 16. 
The ice dynamics at Briksdalsbreen were studied by measuring front position, surface 
elevation, ice motion and melting (chap. 4). The measurements were initiated in 1996 
and completed in 2000. 
An ice-dammed lake at Harbardsbreen has been observed since the early 1990's. The 
observations were continued in 2000 with photography being performed in April, July 
and September (chap. 8). 
A number of measurements were performed at Svartisheibreen during the period 
1988-94 (Kjøllmoen & Kennett 1995). Mass balance, ice movement, front position 
change, surface elevation and water level in a small lake in front of the glacier 
12 
terminus (Heiavatnet) were measured. Annual observations of water level in 
Heiavatnet, equilibrium line altitude and changes in ice thickness on the snout have 
been perforrned since 1995 and were eontinued in 2000 (ehap. 12). 
Meteorologieal observations were performed at Nigardsbreen, Engabreen, 
Harbardsbreen and Langfjordjøkelen. 
Svartisen Subglacial Laboratory was initiated in 1992 and since then has been used by

2 Alfotbreen (Bjarne Kjøllmoen) 
Ålfotbreen ice cap (61 °4S'N, S040'E) is 17 km::! and it is the westernmost and the 
most maritime glader in Norway. Mass balance studies have been carried out on two 
adjacent north-fadng outlet gladers - Ålfotbreen (4.4 km::!) and Hansebreen (2.9 km::!). 
The westernmost of these has been the subject of mass balance investigations since 
1963, and has always been reported as Ålfotbreen. On Hansebreen the investigations 
started in 1986. None ofthe oudet glaciers from the icecap are given a name on the 
offidal maps. To distinguish the two different glaciers the last one has been given the 
name Hansebreen. Ålfotbreen inc1uding its component parts and its surroundings is 
shown in Figure 2-1.

The measurements at Hansebreen were initiated in order to investigate whether mass 
balanee results at Ålfotbreen were representative of the region. Gradually it became 
dear that there was an explicit difference in snow accumulation between the two 
glaciers. Ålfotbreen receives more snow than Hansebreen, particularly in years with 
large accumulation. The difference is probably due to wind drift, which lead to 
increased accumulation on Ålfotbreen. Accordingly, it seems that Hansebreen is the 
most representative of these two glaciers (Haakensen 1999), for the region. 
1.2 Mass balanee 2000 
Fieldwork 
Accumulation measurements were performed between 30th April and 4th May. 
Calculation of winter balanee at Ålfotbreen and Hansebreen is based on (Fig. 2-2): 
• Direct measurement of tower T49 (1380 m a.s.l.) showing a snow depth of 
10.0 m. It was also possible to make a correlation between a substitute stake and a 
stake that emerged by melting during the summer at position 12 (970 m a.s.l.). 
The snow depth was 6.9 m at this position. 
• 94 snow depth soundings along a total of 13 km of profiles at Ålfotbreen and 65 
snow depth soundings along 10 km of profiles at Hansebreen. For Ålfotbreen the 
number of point measurements above 1100 m a.s.l. is more than sufficient but 
rather poor below this level. For Hansebreen, point measurements are well-
represented over the entire glacier surface. Snow depth varied between 6 and 12 
m at Ålfotbreen and from 6Y2 to about 11 m at Hansebreen. In spite of a snow 
depth of more than 10 m, the summer surface (SS) could be easily identified over 
the entire glacier. 
• Snow density was measured down to SS (7.4 m) at position 37 (1205 m a.s.l.). 
The location of stakes and tower, dens it y pit and sounding profiles are shown in 
Figure 2-2. 
Ablation was measured on 8th November. The net balanee was directly measured at 
stakes in eight different positions between 970 and 1380 m a.s.l. at Ålfotbreen, and at 
two stake positions (60 - 1070 m a.s.l. and 80 - 1130 m a.s.l.) at Hansebreen. There 
was about 4 m of snow remaining in the uppermost parts of the glacier, and 
approximate1y 2 m in the intermediate parts (ca. 1200 m a.s.1.). At the lowest stake 
position (970 m a.s.1.) as well as all the snow having melted, about 1 m of ice had 
me1ted also. At the time of ablation measurements about 50 cm of fresh snow had 
come at both Ålfotbreen and Hansebreen. The fresh snow is not inc1uded in this years 
mass balanee ca1culation.

Results 
The mass balanee is ealculated using the traditional method, which means the balanee 
between two sueeessive "summer surfaees". The ealculations are bas ed on a glacier 
map from 1988. 
Winter ba/ance 
The ealculation of winter balanee is based on point measurements of snow depth 
(stakes, tower and probings) and on measurement of snow density in one loeation. 
A density profile is modelled from the snow dens it y measured at 1205 m a.s.l. The 
mean snow density of 7.4 m snow was 0.56 glem', whieh is an unusually high dens it y 
for winter. The dens it y profile is assumed to be representative for both Ålfotbreen and 
Hansebreen. 
The ealculation of winter balanee is performed by plotting the point measurements 
(water equivalents) in a diagram. Based on a visual evaluation the eurve was drawn 
and a mean value for eaeh 50 m height interval was estimated. 
Winter balanee at Ålfotbreen in 2000 was 5.6 ±0.3 m w.eqv., eorresponding to a 
volume of 24 ±2 mill. m' of water. The result is 149 % of the mean winter balanee for 
16 
1963-99, and 134 % of the mean for 1986-99 (for comparison with Hansebreen). This 
winterbalance was exceeded only in 1990 (6.0 m w.eqv.). 
The winter balanee at Hansebreen was 4.7 ±0,3 m w.eqv., corresponding to a volurne 
of 14 ±2 mill. m3 of water. The result is 132 % of the mean value for the period of 
investigation, and this is the largest winter balanee ever measured at Hansebreen. 
Summer balanee 
The density of the remaining snow is estimated to be 0.60 g/cm3, while the dens it y of 
melted ice is estimated to 0.90 glem3• 
The summer balanee at Ålfotbreen was measured and calculated directly at eight 
stakes, and increases from about -3 m w.eqv. in the upper parts of the glader, to 
nearly -5 m at the tongue. Based on estimated density and stake measurements the 
summer balanee for Ålfotbreen was calculated as -3.6 ±0.3 m w.eqv. corresponding 
to -16 ±1 mill. m3 of water. The result is 106 % of the average between 1963 and 
1999, and 102 % of the average between 1986 and 1999. 
The summer balanee for Hansebreen was measured and calculated at two stakes, both 
ca. -4 m w.eqv. Based on these two stakes the summer balanee was -3.8 ±0.5 m 
w.eqv. or -11 ±2 mill. m3 of water. The result is 106 % of the mean value over 1986-
99. Because of the low number of stakes at Hansebreen, the result is more uncertain 
than that for Ålfotbreen. 
Net balanee 
The net balanee at Ålfotbreen for 2000 was calculated as +2.0 ±0.4 m w.eqv., or a 
surplus of 9 ±2 mill. m3 of water. Since 1988, Ålfotbreen has had only one year with a 
negative net balanee (1996). The accumulated net balanee is 15.1 m w.eqv. for the 
period 1963-2000, and 10.8 m w.eqv. for the period 1986-2000. The mean net 
balanee is +0.35 m w.eqv. during 1963-99, and +0.63 m during 1986-99. The diagram 
in Figure 2-3 shows that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 1025 m a.s.l., which 
is about 200 m lower than a year with zero net balance. The Accumulation Area Ratio 
(AAR) was 96 %. 
The net balanee at Hansebreen was calculated as +0.9 ±0.4 m w.eqv., or a surplus of 3 
± 1 mill. m3 of water. The accumulated net balanee since 1986 is slightly positive 
(+0.3 m w.eqv.). The mean value for the period 1986-99 (-0.04 m) shows that the 
glader has been dose to balanee during the last 14 years. According to the diagram in 
Figure 2-4, ELA was 1075 m a.s.l., and hence, AAR was 81 %. 
The rnass balanee results are shown in Tables 2-1 (Ålfotbreen) and 2-2 (Hansebreen). 
The corresponding eurves for specific and volurne balanee are shown in Figures 2-3 
(Ålfotbreen) and 2-4 (Hansebreen). The historical mass balanee results from 
Ålfotbreen are presented in Figure 2-5 and those from Hansebreen in Figure 2-6.

Jostefonn (61 °25'N, 6°35'E) is a small plateau glaeier (12.5 km2) located 10 km 
south-west of Jostedalsbreen in western Norway (Fig. 3-1). The altitude range of this 
glaeier is 960-1620 m a.s.l. Mass balanee measurements have been carried out on two 
south-east facing outlets (Fig. 3-1) covering an area of 3.8 km2 • Mass balanee 
measurements were initiated in the autumn of 1995 and were terminated in the 
autumn of 2000.

3.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Winter accumulation was measured on 29th April. The calculation of winter balanee 
is based on the following data (Fig. 3-1): 
• Snow depth measurements by coring at 1035 m a.s.l. (stake 10), 1050 m a.s.l. 
(stake 20), 1355 m a.s.l. (stake 30), 1460 m a.s.l. (stake 40) and 1620 m a.s.l. 
(stake 50) showing snow depths of 6.9,6.6,6.5,5.6 and 5.8 metres respectively. 
21 
• Snow density measured down to 4.2 m depth at stake 50 (1620 m a.s.l.). The 
mean snow density was 0.46 g/em3• The summer surfaee (SS) was at a depth of 
5.8 m. 
• Snow depth measured by sounding at 73 loeations along 10 km of profil es 
(Fig. 3-1). The SS was fairly easy to deteet exeept at the summit, near stake 50. 
The snow depth was between 6 and 8 meter. 
Summer ablation and net balanee was measured on 14th September. There was up to 
0.5 m fresh snow on the glaeier above 1300 m a.s.l.. The net balanee was measured at 
five loeations between 1035 and 1620 m a.s.l. At stake loeations 50, 40 and 30, there 
were 1.75, 1.30 and 1.75 - 2.20 meter of snow respeetively remaining from last 
winter. At loeations 10 and 20 on the glaeier tongues there were severai stakes, some 
with snow remaining and some with blue iee exposed. The temporary snow line eould 
not be deteeted, but the temporary snow line altitude was estimated as approximately 
1050 m a.s.l. based on stake measurements and the distribution of exposed blue iee. 
The seeond half of September and most of Oetober was unusually warm in western 
Norway, and there was thus further melting after the ablation measurements. Ablation 
after 14th September is not included in the ealculations. 
Results 
The mass balanee is ealculated according to a stratigraphic method relating the net 
balanee to the difference between two succes sive "summer surfaces" excluding snow 
accumulation before the date of net balanee measurements but also excluding ablation 
after net balanee measurements. The ealculations are performed using a map from 
1993. 
Winter ba/ance 
A snow depth - water equivalent profile was ealculated based on snow density 
measurements down to 4 .2 m depth at stake 50 (1620 m a.s.l.) and geometrie 
extrapolation down to 9 m. The mean density of 9 m of snow in this profile was 
0.50 g/em3• Snow depth measurements were redueed to water equivalents using this 
profile. 
Snow depth water equivalent values are plotted against altitude. An altitudinal winter 
balanee eurve was drawn based on averaging values over 50 m alt itu din al intervals 
and visual evaluation. The greater snow aeeumulation in the steep, east-faeing area 
between stakes 50 and 30 than on the ridge between stakes 50 and 40 was taken into 
aeeount. Lower aeeumulation in the western iee fall between stakes 10 and 30 than at 
the eastern glaeier tongue was also eonsidered. From this eurve a mean value for eaeh 
100 m height interval is determined. The winter balanee was 13 ±1 million eubie 
metres water equivalent or 3.5 ±0.2 meter. This is 132 % of the 1996 - 99 average, 
2.6 m w. eqv.

Winter balanee on the studied part of Jostefonn as observed on 29th April 2000, interpolated by 
kriging from 73 soundings and cores, and nine extrapolate points. Mean winter balanee for this 
spatial distribution is 3.7 m water equivalent; the winter balanee calculated from the altitudinal 
distribution gives 3.5 m water equivalent. 
The measurement program does not cover the eastern slopes of the western, highest 
part of the glacier (Fig. 3-1). Winter snow accumulation in this region is probably 
higher than measured elsewhere on the glacier, thus causing an underestimate of the 
true winter balance. The spatial distribution of winter balance was calculated by 
krieg-interpolation using measurements from 29th April and ni ne extra points 
estimated from nearby measurements and assumed wind and topography effects 
(Fig. 3-2). The average winter balance based on this map was 3.7 m w.eqv. 
Summer balanee 
The summer balance was calculated at five stake positions between 1035 and 1620 
m a.s.l., and varied from -2.2 at the summit to -3.5 m w. eqv. on the glaeier tongues. 
From these values a summer balanee curve was drawn (Fig. 3-2). The summer 
balanee was calculated as -2.5 ±0.3 m w.eqv., which is -9 ±1 million cubic metres of 
water. The result is 85 % of the 1995-99 average, -2.9 m w .eqv. 
Net balanee 
The net balanee at Jostefonn was calculated as 4 ±1 mill. m3 water or +1.0 ±0.3 m 
w.eqv. The 1996-99 average is -0.3 meter. The ELA for 2000 determined from the net 
balanee curve in figure 3-2 is 1050 m a.s.l. The corresponding AAR is 90 %. The 
altitudinal distribution of winter-, summer- and net balances is shown in Figure 3-3 
and Table 3-1. Results from 1996-2000 are shown in Figure 3-4.

4 Briksdalsbreen (HaIIgeirElvehøy) 
Briksdalsbreen (61 °40N, 6°57'E) is a western outlet glacier (l0.4 km2) from the 
Jostedalsbreen ice cap. Most of its areal extent is on the plateau between 1500 and 
1915 m a.s.l., with only 12 % of the glacier area below 1500 m a.s.l. Until recently 
the glacier terminated in the proglacial Lake Briksdalsvatnet at 346 m a.s.1. 
The glacier advanced 390 metres between 1988 and 1996 and now covers the former 
lake (Fig. 4-1) . 
Figure 4-1 
The lower part of Briksdalsbreen on 2nd May 2000. Velocity measurements were made in the gently 
sloping area between the icefall and the terminus. This part of the glacier covers former Lake 
Briksdalsvatn. The river outlet has started to form on the right side of the terminus. The terminus 
position between the river outlet and the first prominent boulder to the lett of the river outlet (arrow) 
has been surveyed on severai occasions (Fig. 4-2 and 4-4).

Velocity measurements and surface profiling started in the autumn 1996 and were 
c\osed down in the spring of 2000 covering four winter seasons and tree summer 
seasons. Figure 4-2 summarises the measurements in May 2000. 
4.1 Front position change 
Front position measurements began in 1900 (Rekstad, 1904). Between 1946 and 1951 
the glacier front position retreated quickJy and Lake Briksdalsvatnet became exposed. 
Between 1973 and 1996 the glacier ad vanced about 500 metres and fi lied the lake 
again . This last advance culminated in 1996. After three years in approximately the 
same position, the glacier front retreated 30 metres in 2000 (Fig. 4-3). This is the 
largest annual retreat since 1951.

Figure 4-4 
Surveyed terminus positions between 1997 
and 2000. The most advanced position was 
recorded in May 1998. The large boulder is 
shown in Figure 4-1 . 
The lower part of the glaeier has been surveyed severai times between 1997 and 2000. 
The surveyed area was limited by crevasses on the left side of the tongue (as seen 
from the valley) and the iee fall from the plateau (Fig. 4-1 and 4-2). This was done to 
avoid large temporai ehanges in elevation due to eollapse of iee bloeks in erevassed 
regions. Surfaee undulations in the surveyed area were 1-2 metres vertieally and 
20-30 metres horizontally. The surveying was earried out to show these variations. 
From point elevations regular S x S metres grids have been ealculated by TIN 
(Triangu lation with linear INterpolation) interpolation. A total of six grids from 
18th June and ISth Oetober 1997, 9th May and 24u1 September 1998, 9th May 1999 and 
2nd May 2000 were ealeulated. The resuIts from 2000 are shown in Figure 4-2. 
A representative elevation profile has been ea1culated from the grids. Changes in 
surfaee elevation are shown in figure 4-S. From June 1997 to May 2000, surfaee 
lowering along the profile was 7 metres. The elevation was hi ghest in June 1997 and 
lowest in September 1998 (a lowering of ten metres eompared with June 1997). After 
an inerease in elevation from September 1998 to May 1999 ( +7 metres along the 
profile), the thinning eontinued from May 1999 to May 2000 (-S metres).ln the 
summers of 1997 and 1998 the surfaee elevation ehange along the profile was -8 and 
-4 metres. During the two summers the iee melting at two stakes in the area was 13 
and 9 metres. This indieates that the glaeier f10w eompensated for about S metres of 
iee metting during the summer seasons.

4.3 Glaeier velocity 
The glaeier velocity has been calculated from repeated surveys of stakes drill ed into 
the ice. The average velocity has been calculated for periods between surveys, and 
the velocity is plotted between two surveyed positions. 
Due to intense melting during the summer CIO - 12 metres of ice) and glaeier 
movement of 0.2 - 0.3 metres per day, the stakes had to be re-positioned and 
surveyed severaI times during a summer season. Varying dates of survey and varying 
glacio-hydrological conditions from year to year makes comparison of summer 
velocities difficult . To assess the changes in glaeier f10w we therefore look at winter 
velocities which are calculated for periods of 7 - 8 months, thus making the values 
less dependent on the various survey dates and the glacio-hydrological conditions. 
Figure 4-6 shows velocities calculated at stakes as a function of distance from the 
terminus. The effect of variations in front position during the period of measurements 
was ignored since the total front position change during this period was small. The 
glaeier velocity decreases up to 50 % from the foot of the ice fall to within 100 metres 
of the terminus. The 1996-97 velocities are significantly higher than those in later 
periods. In 1998-99 the velocity was slightly higher than in 1997-98 and 1999-2000. 
The surface elevation change toa was higher in 1998-99 than in 1997-98 and 1999-
2000, indicating a higher dynamic activity this winter. 
To obtain a time series of glaeier velocity we used a fixed point 325 metres up glaeier 
from the terminus and about 430 m a.s.l., and calculated the glaeier velocity at this 
position by interpolation between velocities measured at stakes (Fig. 4-7) . The 
calculated velocities were significantly higher in 1996-97 than later periods. The 
29 
winter velocity in 1996-97 was 44 % higher than in 1997-2000, and the highest 
velocity (0.36 m/d) was found in the first part of summer 1997. Since autumn 1997 
the glacier velocity seems to have stabilised at a lower level.

Glacier velocity (m/d) at stakes during winter and spring of 1997,1998,1999 and 2000. The slight 
difference in the period between the years can account for some of the difference, mainly due to 
higher glacier velocity in late spring/early summer. The reduction in velocity corresponds well with 
the stagnation of the glacier front position and the lowering of the glacier surface.

5 Nigardsbreen (BjarneKjøllmoen) 
Nigardsbreen (61 °42'N, 7°08'E) is one of the largest and most famous outlet glaciers 
(47.8 km2) from Jostedalsbreen, flowing south-east from the centre of the ice cap 
(Fig. 5-1) . Nigardsbreen accounts for approximately 10 % of the total area of 
Jostedalsbreen, and extends from 1960 m a.s.\. down to approximately 320 m a.s.\. 
Glaciological investigations in 2000 include mass balance, front position change and 
various meteorological measurements. Some observations of the ice-dammed lake 
Brimkjelen at Tunsbergdalsbreen have also been perforrned (Fig. 5-10). Nigardsbreen 
has been the subject of mass balance investigation since 1962.

total area of 48 km2 (1984). 24 % of this area lies below the average equilibrium line altitude (1962-
2000), which is at about 1490 m a.s.1.

5.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Accumulation measurements were undertaken between 3rd and 5th May and the 
calculation of winter balanee is based on (Fig. 5-2): 
§ Direct measurements at the towers T95 (1685 m a.s.\.) and T56 (1805 moh .), 
which showed snow depths of7.5 m and 7.6 m respectively. 
§ Core samples at 1325 (5.2 m snow), 1610 (5.9 m), 1705 (6.9 m), 1760 (7.2 m) 
and 1960 m a.s.\. (6.1 m) . 
31 
• 117 snow depth soundings along approximately 30 km of profiles between 
elevations of 1315 and 1940 m a.s.l., and some soundings at 600 and 1000 m a.s.l. 
Due to high snow density and an indistinct summer surface the probing 
conditions were difficult, especially in the higher areas (above 1700 m a.s.l.). 
Down at the g1acier tongue the snow depth was ca. 2 m in 600 ID altitude and 
about 4.5 m in 1000 maltitude. On the plateau snow depth varied between 6.5 
and 8 m. 
• Snow dens it y was measured down to 4.3 m depth (SS at 5.5 m) at stake position 
53 (1325 m a.s.l.) and down to 5.5 m depth (SS at 6.1 m) at position 57 (1960 m 
a.s.l.). 
Location of stakes and towers, density pit, core samp1es and sounding profiles are

Ablation measurements were carried out on 13th September. The net balanee was 
measured directly at stakes in eleven different positions between 600 and 1960 m 
a.s.l. On the glaeier tongue the net melting since autumn 1999 was about 7 m of ice at 
600 m altitude and about 3 m of ice at 1000 maltitude. There was between 4 and 5 m 
of snow remaining on the plateau. Up to 60 cm of fresh snow had fallen in the upper 
parts of the glaeier. A density measurement of the 4.2 m of remaining snow was 
performed at T95. 
32 
The seeond half of September and most of Oetober was unusually warm in the 
Jostedalsbreen area, so there was further melting after the ablation measurements. 
Ablation after 13th September, amounting to 1.3 m w.eqv. at 600 maltitude, 0.8 m 
w.eqv. at 1000 m altitude and 0.2 m w.eqv. at 1325 maltitude, is not inc1uded in the 
ea1culations. Instead, it will be inc1uded in the winter balanee in 200 l. 
Results 
The mass balanee is ea1culated using the traditional method, whieh means the balanee 
between two sueeessive "summer surfaces". The calculations are based on the glaeier 
map from 1984. 
Winter ba/ance 
The ea1culations of winter balanee are based on point measurements of snow depth 
(towers, probings and core drillings) and on measurement of snow density at two 
locations. 
Density profiles were modell ed from the snow dens it y measured at 1325 (5 .2 m 
snow) and 1960 m altitude (6.1 m). Using these models mean snow dens it y was 0.49 
glem3 (1325 m a.s.l.) and 0.51 g/em3 (1960 m a.s.l.) . The model from 1325 m altitude 
is used in the areas below 1640 m a.s.l., whilst the model from 1960 m altitude is used 
in the are as above 1640 m a.s.l. 
The winter balanee ea1culations are performed using two different methods. In the 
first method, winter balanee is performed by plotting measurements (water 
equivalents) in a diagram (Fig. 5-4). Based on visual evaluation a eurve is drawn and 
a mean value for eaeh 100 m height interval estimated. The areas above 1315 m a.s.l. 
are well represented with point measurements. Below this altitude the eurve pattern is 
based on some probings at 1000 and 600 maltitude. The winter balanee, henee, was 
3.4 ±0.2 m w.eqv. eorresponding to a water volume of 162 ±1O mill. m3• The result is 
141 % of the mean value for the period 1962-99. There is only three years (1967, 
1989 and 1990) with a greater winter balanee on Nigardsbreen. 
The winter balanee is also ca1culated using a gridding method based on the spatial 
distribution of the snow depth measurements (Fig. 5-3). In areas with insufficient 
measurements some (18) simulated points are extracted. These point values are 
modell ed based on measurements from the period 1975-81 (years with extensive 
measurements) . Water equivalents for each cell in a 100 x 100 m grid are ca1culated 
and summarized. The result based on this method, which is a control of the traditional 
method, shows a winter balanee of 3.2 m w.eqv. (153 mill. m3 water). 
A map illustrating the snow distribution is shown in Figure 5-3. 
Summer ba/ance 
The dens it y of the 4.6 m of remaining snow (1685 m a.s.l.) was determined as 
0.61 g/cm3, whilst the density of melted iee is estimated to be 0.90 g/cm3•

The summer balanee was measured and ealculated direetly at nine stakes and towers, 
and inereases from -0.5 m w.eqv. in the upper parts of the glaeier to about -7 m down 
on the tongue. Based on measurements and estimates of stakes and snow dens it y the 
summer balanee was ealculated to be -1.7 ±0.3 m w.eqv., whieh is -79 ±15 mill. m3 of 
water. The result is 86 % of the average for 1962-99. Only 50 % of the snow 
aeeumulation had melted.

Net ba/ance 
The net balanee at Nigardsbreen for 2000 was ealculated as + l.7 m ±0.3 m w.eqv., 
whieh means a surplus of 82 ±15 mill.m3 water. The mean value for the period 1962-
99 is +0.50 m w.eqv. Sinee 1988, Nigardsbreen has had only ane year with negative 
net balanee (1996), and the average for 1989-2000 is +l.07 m w.eqv. The 
aeeumulated net balanee for the entire period 1962-2000 is 19.6 m w.eqv. The 
diagram in Figure 5-4 indieates that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 1250 m 
a.s.l., which is about 320 m lower than a year in balanee. The Aeeumulation Area 
Ratio (AAR) was 93 %. 
The mass balanee results are shown in Table 5-1 and Figure 5-4. Historie mass

5.2 Front position change 
Due to the advance of the glaeier front position over the last few years, the glaeier 
stream changed channel pattern in 1999 from one main ri ver to severai smaller 
channels. This situation persisted over the last year (2000). The glaeier front and 
stream pattern as photographed on 26th July 2000 is shown in Figure 5-6. 
Figure 5-6 
Since 1988 Nigardsbreen has advanced about 260 metres. The glacial stream pattern has changed 
because of the advance. The photograph was taken on 26th July 2000.

Changes in front position are annually measured from fixed points along a straight 
line drawn from the original stream outlet. The measurement in October 2000 shows 
that Nigardsbreen has advanced 23 m since autumn 1999. After a long period with 
recession that stopped in 1988, the total advance amounts to about 260 m. The annual 
and cumulative advanee since 1988 is shown in Figure 5-7.

5.3 Meteorological measurements 
Meteoro1ogical observations, such as air temperature, wind speed and wind direction 
are recorded automatically at the field station Steinmann (position 51 in Fig. 5-2). 
Down in the Jostedalen valley, there is another meteorological station, Bjørkehaug, 
run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. 
Results of the air temperature measurements at Steinmann (1630 m a.s.l.) and 
Bjørkehaug (324 m a.s.l.) during the period 1989-2000 are presented in Table 5-2. 
The values indicate the daily mean air temperature for the "summer season" (defined 
as l st June to 30th September). 
The summer 2000 temperature at Steinmann was 2.0 DC, whilst the mean temperature 
for the period 1989-99 is 2.7 0e. The corresponding va1ues at Bjørkehaug were 11.8 
and 11.6 DC. The 1apse rate between the two stations was 0.75 °C in 2000.

5.4 Tunsbergdalsbreen 
Mass balanee 
From 1966 to 1972 mass balanee measurements were made simultaneously at both 
Tunsbergdalsbreen (47.7 km2) and Nigardsbreen. A linear regression ana1ysis of the 
results from these seven years gives an equation that can be used to calcu1ate the 
annual net balanee of Tunsbergdalsbreen. 
T = 0.987 . N - 0.283 
T = Net balanee at Tunsbergdalsbreen, and N = Net balanee at Nigardsbreen. 
For 2000 the net balanee at Tunsbergdalsbreen was estimated as + lAI ±OA5 m 
w.eqv., corresponding to a surplus of about 67 mill. m3 of water. 
Since 1962 the estimated accumulated net balanee is about 8 m w.eqv. (Fig. 5-8). The 
entire surp1us has occured since 1988. 
Based on the measurements during 1966-72 a correlation between the equilibrium 
line altitude (ELA) for Nigardsbreen and Tunsbergdalsbreen was estab1ished. The 
analysis indicates that the ELA at Tunsbergdalsbreen in autumn 2000 was about 
1100 m a.s.l.

Annual and cumulative net balance for Tunsbergdalsbreen for the period 1962-2000. The values are 
measured for the period 1966-72. The calculations indicate a surplus of ca. 8 m since 1962. 
Brimkjelen 
About 3 km above the western side of the glacier snout lies Brimkjelen, which is an 
ice-dammed lake. Due to the glacier recession during the last century, the area and 
volume of the lake has decreased considerably. The last estimate of the volurne was 
about 2 million m3 in 1982. 
From 1984 to 1997 no systematie observations were made of the lake. Observations 
was resumed in the autumn of 1997 and continued in 2000 by photographing on 27th 
Julyand 13th September. The lake was empty on both occasions. The circular pattern 
of crevasses and some subsidence of the ice towards the lake, however, may indicate 
that a small part of the glacier has been afloat.

6 Austdalsbreen (HallgeirElvehøy) 
Austdalsbreen (61 °45'N, 7°20'E) is an eastem outlet from the northem part of 
Jostedalsbreen and co vers the altitudinal range between 1200 and 1760 m a.s.l. The 
glaeier calves into the regulated lake Austdalsvatnet. Glaciologica1 investigations 
started at Austdalsbreen in 1986 in connection with the construetion of a 
hydroelectric power plant for which lake Austdalsvatnet is a reservoir. 
The glaciological investigations in 2000 included mass balanee front position change 
and glacier velocity. Mass balanee at Austdalsbreen has been measured since 1988.

6.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Winter accumulation was measured 30th April and 1 st May. Calculation of winter 
balanee is based on the following data (Fig. 6-1): 
• Snow depth measurements at stake 6.98 (1240 m a.sJ.), 7.99 (1240 m a.s.l.) and 
T70 (1545 m a.s.l.) showing snow depth of 2.2,2.8 and 7.1 m respectively. 
40 
• Snow depth measurements by coring at 1320 m a.s.1. (stake 92.00), 1400 m 
a.s.l.(stake 90.00), 1440 m a.s.l.(stake 24.00),1505 m a.s.l.(stake 60.00) and 1730 
m a.s.l. (stake 80.00) showing snow depth of 5.5, 5.2, 6.3, 6.8 and 5.2 m 
respective1y. 
• Snow depth measured by sounding at 86 10cations along 18 km of profiles. At 
Austdalsnuten above 1700 m a.s.l. the snow depth was 5 meter. Between 1450 
and 1600 m a.s.l. the snow depth was between 6 and 7 meter. Between 1300 and 
1450 m a.s.l. the snow depth vas between 5 and 6 meter. Below 1300 m a.s.L the 
snow depth varied between 2 and 5 meter. The summer surfaee from 1999 (SS) 
was easy to detect in all areas except dose to the northem drainage divide. 
• Snow density measured down to 5.4 m depth at stake 60.00 (1505 m a.s.l.). Snow 
depth to SS was 6.8 metres. Mean snow density was 0.47 glem3• 
Summer ab1ation and net balance was measured 14th September. The net balance was 
measured at eight locations between 1240 and 1730 m a.s.l. At stake 80 
(1730 m a.s.l.) 2 meter of snow remained. At stakes between 1440 and 1600 m a.s.l. 
(24.00, 60.00 and T70) between 2V2 and 3Y2 meter remained. At stakes between 1300 
and 1400 m a.s.l. (192.98,43.96 and 90.96) between V2 and 1V2 meter snow remained. 
CIo se to the glacier front (1240 m a.s.l.) ca. 2 % m ice and all the snow from last 
winter had melted away. The transient snow line altitude (TSL) was approximately 
1300 m a.s.l. 
The second half of September and most of October was unusual warm in the 
Jostedalsbreen area, and subsequent the melting continued after the ablation 
measurement. The ablation after 14th September, amounting to between 0,8 m w.eqv. 
1240 m a.s.l. and 0.1 m w.eqv. 1550 m a.s.l., is not inc1uded in the calculations. It will 
be inc1uded in the winter balance of 2001. 
Results 
The mass balance is calculated according to a stratigraphic method relating the net 
balance to the difference between to succes sive summer surfaces exc1uding snow 
accumulation before the date of net balanee measurements but also exc1uding ablation 
after net balance measurements. The ca1cu1ations are based on a map from 1988 
adjusted for glacier retreat between 1988 and 2000. 
Winter balanee 
A snow depth - water equivalent profile was ca1culated based on snow density 
measurements 1505 m a.s.l. The mean density of 5 meters of snow in this profile was 
0.47 glcm3• Snow depth measurements are reduced to water equivalents using this 
profile. 
Snow depth water equivalent values are plotted against altitude in a diagram. Based 
on averaging of values within 50 meter altitudinal intervals and a visual evaluation, 
an altitudinal winter balanee curve was drawn. From this curve a mean value for each 
50 m height interval is determined. Below 1300 m a.s.l. the snow depth is varying a 
41 
lot due to irregular topography and many crevasses which trap a large portion of the 
drifting snow. In this area the higher values are thought to be more representative. 
The winter balanee was 33 ±2 mill. m} water equivalents or 2.8 ±0.2 meter. This is 
117 % of the 1988 - 99 average which is 2.37 meter water equivalents 
Summer ba/ance 
The summer balanee was calculated for eight stake positions between 1240 and 1730 
m a.s.l., and increases from -1.0 m w.eqv. above 1550 m a.s.l to approximately -3.5 
m w.eqv. dose to the terminus. From these values a summer balanee curve was drawn 
(Fig. 6-3). 
Calving from the glaeier terminus is calculated as the annual volurne of ice (in water 
equivalents) that is transported through a cross section dose to the terminus, and 
adjusted for the volurne change related to the annual front position change. This 
volurne is calculated as: 
where Pice = 0.9 g/cm3, Uice and Uf is annual glaeier velocity and front position change 
averaged across the terminus (m/a), W is terminus width (m), and H is mean ice 
thickness along the terminus (m). The glaeier velocity, Uice. was 60 ±10 m/a (chapter 
6.3), and Uf was +2 ±5 mla (chapter 6.2). The ice thickness H was 43 ±5 meter based 
on surface altitude surveyed 14th September 2000 and a bottom topography map 
compiled from radar ice thickness measurements (1986), hot water drilling ( 1987) 
and lake depth surveying (1988 and 1989), and W was 1050 ±50 meter. The calving 
volurne was 2.4 ±0.5 mill. m3 or 0.20 ±0.04 meter w.eqv. averaged across the glaeier 
area (11.8 km::\ 
The summer balanee (calving induded) was calculated to -1.7 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which 
corresponds to -20 ±2 mill. m} of water. The result is 75 % of the 1988-99 average of 
-2.22 m w.eqv. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee at Austdalsbreen was calculated to 13 ±3 mill. m3 water or + 1.1 ±0.3 
m w.eqv. The 1988-99 average is +0,16 meter. The ELA for 2000 determined from 
the net balanee curve in Figure 6-2 is 1315 m a.s.l. which is dose to the observed 
TSL at approximately 1300 m a.s.l. The accumulation area ratio (AAR) was 87 %. 
The altitudinal distribution of winter-, summer- and net balances are shown in Figure 
6-2 and Table 6-1. Results from 1988-2000 are shown in Figure 6-3.

Winter-, summer and net balances at Austdalsbreen during the period 1988-2000. The cumulative 
net balanee was +3,0 m w.eqv. Mean values for the period 1988-2000 are bw=2.37 m, b.=-2.22 m and 
bn=+0.15 m w.eqv. 
6.2 Front position change 
Seven points along the terminus was surveyed on the 14th September 2000. Between 
30th September 1999 and 14th September 2000 the mean front position change was +2 
±5 meter (Fig. 6-4). That means the front position is unchanged since September 
1999. The front position retreat since 1988 is approximately 340 meter. 
Due to large variations in calving during the year, the annual variations in front 
position is large compared to the year-to-year front position change. Figure 6-5 
illustrates how the front position at a central flow line has varied during the last 13 
years. As a consequence of the lake regulation it was expected that the glacier 
terminus would retreat. A modelling effort resulted in a prediction for future front 
position change shown as a broken line in Figure 6-5.

this flow line (dots). The solid line indicates annual variations in front position. The glacier 
advances from December to July when the lake is frozen, and retreats during July-December due to 
calving. In 1988 the level of lake Austdalsvatnet was regulated as a reservoir for the first time. The

Glacier velocity (m/a , September-September) along a central flow line interpolated between 
averaged stake positions at the lower part of the glaeier. Between the lowest stake and the terminus 
the veloeity is extrapolated (broken line). The distance 4600 meter from iee divide eorresponds 
approximately to stake 192 (Fig. 6-1). Between 1988 and 2000 the terminus has retreated 340 
meters. 
6.3 Glaeier velocity 
Glacier velocities are calculated from repeated surveys of stakes on the lower part of 
the glacier. The results are compared with results from 1988-1999 (Fig. 6-6) . 
Estimated glacier velocity at the terminus is simjlar to 1995 and 1999 but less than 
1993 and 1998. Further upstream the year-to-year variations are rmnor. 
The glacier velocity close to the terminus seems to be vary ing around 85 mla with 
inter-annual variations due to differences in annuallake level variations in the 
reservOlr. 
To calculate the calving volurne (chapter 6.1) we estimate the glacier velocity 
averaged across the front width and depth. Surface, centre line velocity is calculated 
from measurements at stake 6.98 and 7.99 (76 .5 mla and 71.8 mla), the average 
distance from stake to terminus, and estimated strain rate close to the termjnus based 
on earlier measurements (0.1 a-l). The cross-sectional averaged glacier velocity is 
estimated to be 70% of the centre line surface velocity based on ear1ier measurements 
and estimates of the amount of glacier sliding at the bed, resu lting in an terminus 
cross-sectional averaged glacier velocity of 60 ± 10 rnIa.

7 Hardangerjøkulen (HallgeirElvehøyand 
Karin Krantz) 
Hardangerjøkulen (61 °30'N, 7°30'E) is the sixth largest (73 km2) glacier in Norway. 
The glacier is situated on the main water divide between Hardangerfjorden and 
Hallingdalen. In 1963, the Norwegian Polar Institute started mass balance 
measurements on the south-western outlet glacier Rembesdalskåka (17 km2), which 
drains to the valley Simadalen and Hardangerfjorden. This valley has been ravaged by 
jøkulhlaups from the glacier-dammed Lake Demmevatnet, the latest occurring in 
1937 and 1938. Since 1985, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate 
(NVE) has been responsible for the mass balance investigations at Rembesdalskåka. 
The investigated basin covers the altitudinal range between 1020 and 1865 m a.s.l. 
In 2000, the University of Oslo started mass balance measurements on the northern 
outlet glacier Midtdalsbreen (7 km2), which drains towards Hallingdalen. 
Midtdalsbreen covers the altitudinal range from 1380 to 1865 m a.s.l. 
At Midtdalsbreen, the University of Bergen started front position measurements in 
1982. Statkraft initiated front position measurements at Rembesdalskåka in 1995. 
These measurements are described in chapter 17. 
Hardangerjøkulen has been mapped twice, in 1961 and 1995. An analysis ofvolume 
changes between 1961 and 1995 is described in chapter 16.

7.1 Mass balanee at Rembesdalskåka in 2000 
Field work 
Winter accumulation was measured 11 th May. Calculation of winter balance is based 
on the following data (Fig. 7-1): 
• Snow depth measurements at stake 10 (1285 m a.s.l.), 8 (1530 m a.s.l.), T4 (1770 
m a.s.l.) and T2 (1830 m a.s.l.) showing snow depth of 3.9,4.9,6.1 and 5.5 m 
respectively. 
• Snow depth measurements by coring at 1675 m a.s.l. (stake 7) showing snow 
depth of 6.0 metres. 
• Snow dens it y measured down to 5.85 m depth at stake 7 (1675 m a.s.l.). Mean 
snow density was 0.52 g/cm3 . Below the SS at 6.0 m depth there was fim. 
• Snow depth measured by sounding at 81 locations along 18 km of profiles on the 
glacier plateau above 1500 m a.s.l. Between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. the snow 
depth was 4V2 to 6 meters. Above 1700 m a.s.l. the snow depth was 5 to 6V2 meter. 
The SS was fairly easy to detect. 
Summer ablation and net balance was measured 13 th September. There was fresh 
snow on the glacier above 1300-1400 m a.s.l. At the stakes the depth of new snow 
was 0.15 - 0.55 metres. The transient snow line (TSL) could not be detected, but the 
TSL altitude was probably approximately 1400 m a.s.l. The net balance was measured 
at five locations between 1285 and 1830 m a.s.l. At stakes 7, T4 and T2, 3.2, 3.1 and 
3.2 meter of snow, respectively, remained. At stake 8 the remaining snow depth was 
1.2 m. At stake 10 on the glacier tongue (1285 m a.s.l.) ca. lV2 m ice and all the snow 
from last winter had melted away. 
The sec ond half of September and most of October was unusual warm in West-
Norway, and subsequent the melting continued after the ablation measurement. The 
ablation after 13th September, amounting to 1.1 m w.eqv. at stake 10, is not included 
in the calculations. It will be included in the winter balance of 2001. 
Results 
The mass balance is calculated according to a stratigraphic method relating the net 
balance to the difference between two successive "summer surfaces" excluding snow 
accumulation before the date of net balance measurements but also excluding ablation 
after net balance measurements. The calculations are bas ed on a map from 1995. 
Winter ba/ance 
A snow depth - water equivalent profile was calculated based on snow dens it y 
measurements 1675 m a.s.l.. The mean dens it y of 5 meters of snow in this profile was 
0.53 g/cm3• Snow depth measurements are reduced to water equivalents using this 
profile.

Snow depth water equivalent values are plotted against altitude in a diagram. Based 
on averaging of values within 50 meter altitudinal intervals and a visual evaluation, 
an altitudinal winter balanee eurve was drawn. Below 1500 m a.s.l. the only snow 
depth measurement was at stake 10. Therefore, the winter balanee eurve had to be 
extrapolated from measurements at stake 10 and 8. From this curve a mean value for 
eaeh 50 m height interval is determined. The winter balanee was 50 ±3 mill. m3 water 
equivalents or 2.9 ±O.2 meter. This is 138 % of the 1963 - 99 average which is 2.12 
m w.eqv., and 134 % ofthe 1995-99 average of 2.19 m w.eqv. 
Summer ba/ance 
The summer balanee was ealculated for five stake positions between 1285 and 1830 
m a.s.l. From these values a summer balanee curve was drawn (Fig. 7-2). 
The summer balanee was ealculated to -1.5 ±0.2 m w.eqv., whieh is -26 ±3 mill. m3 
of water. This is 77 % ofthe 1963-99 average whieh is -1.95 m w.eqv. and 66 % of 
the 1995-99 average of -2.27m w.eqv. Only six times in the 37 years of 
measurements the summer balanee was smaller than in 2000. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee at Rembesdalskåka was calculated to 24 ±5 mill. m3 water or + lA 
±0.3 m w.eqv. The 1963-99 average is +0.21 meter, and the 1995-99 average is -0.11 
meter. Only five years in the period 1963-99 the net balanee at Rembesdalskåka has 
been more positive than in 2000. The ELA for 2000 determined from the net balanee 
eurve in Figure 7-2 is 1425 m a.s.l. The aecumulation area ratio (AAR) was 92 %. 
The altitudinal distribution of winter-, summer- and net balanees are shown in Figure 
7-2 and Table 7-1. Results from 1963-2000 are shown in Figure 7-3 and 7-4.

7.2 Mass balanee at Midtdalsbreen in 2000 
Field work 
The winter aeeumulation was measured on 5th May 2000. The aeeumulation was 
estimated from snow depth soundings as shown in Figure 7-5. Sinee there were only a 
few measurements in the upper part of Midtdalsbreen, measurements from 
Rembesdalskåka were used to support the estimation of the winter balanee in the 
upper part of Midtdalsbreen. The sounding eonditions were diffieult due to severai 
layer of iee in the snow paek. 
Snow density measurements at two loeations were used to eonvert snow depth to 
water equivalents. The first site was at the lower part of Midtdalsbreen, at about 1490 
m a.s.l. The mean density was 0.50 g/em3• This measurement was us ed from about 
1550 m a.s.l and down to the front. 
For ealculation of water equivalent in the upper part of Midtdalsbreen the density 
measurements made at stake 7 (1675 m a.s.l) on Rembesdalskåka were used 
(Fig. 7-1). The mean density was 0.53 g/em3• Midtdalsbreen is divided into 50 meter 
intervals and the points in eaeh interval are interpolated with an inverse distanee 
weighing interpalation using the software ARCIINFO.

Stakes (open circles), put out in May 2000, and soundings (closed circles) on Midtdalsbreen. The 
soundings were done the 5th of May 2000. The soundings outside Midtdalsbreen drainage area were 
done by NVE at Rembesdalskåka on the 11th of May 2000 (Fig. 7-1). Contour interval100 metres. 
In May 2000 ten stakes were drilled at Midtdalsbreen (Fig. 7-5). Nine of those were 
used in the minimum measurements. The method is a stratigraphie method, whieh is 
based on measuring the summer surfaees from ane year to the next. The minimum 
measurements of year 2000 were performed in the beginning of January 2001. The 
snow depth of this year snow was measured and together with the height of the stakes 
it was possible to estimate the summer surfaee. The differenee between the snow 
depth in May and the summer surfaee, multiplied with the density of snow/iee is the 
specifie net balanee. The density of remaining snow from last winter was measured in 
September to 0.59 g/em3 and iee is about 0.9 g/em3• The summer balanee is ealculated 
from the winter and net balances. 
Results 
The ealculations are based on a map from 1995. 
The specific mass balanee per altitude is shown in Figure 7-6 and Table 7-2. 
The mean specific winter balanee was 2.9 m w.eqv. and the summer balanee was 
-1.6 m w.eqv. The net balanee was then very positive and estimated to 1.3 m w.eqv. 
The ELA was determined from Figure 7-6 to 1500 ill a.s.l.

8 Harbardsbreen (Bjarne Kjøllmoen) 
Harbardsbreen (61 °40'N, 7°35'E) is a plateau glaeier situated approximately 25 km 
east of Jostedalsbreen in the Breheimen area. Its area is about 25 km2, and of this 
about 13 km2 drains eastward to Steindalselvi and Fivlemyrane reservoir (Fig. 8-1). 
The range in elevation is between 1250 and 1960 m a.s.l. 
The glaciological investigations perforrned in 2000 include mass balance, air 
temperature measurements and observations of an ice-dammed lake. The 
investigations at Harbardsbreen started with aerial photography and mapping in 1996, 
whilst the glaeier has been subject to mass balanee measurements since 1997.

8.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Accumulation was measured on 29th April and the winter balanee calculation is based 
on (Fig. 8-2): 
• Direct measurement of stake 70 (1940 m a.s.l.) showing a snow depth of 2.9 m. It 
was also possible to make connections between substitute stakes at positions 10 
(1285 m a.s.l.), 20 (1415 m a.s.l.), 30 (1490 ill a.s.l.), 40 (1620 m a.s.l.), 50 (1700 
ID a.s.l.), 45 (1720 ID a.s.l.) and 60 (1790 ID a.s.l.) and stakes that emerged by 
melting during the summer. The corresponding snow depths were 4.8,5.1,5.0, 
5.9, 4.5, 5.2 and 4.6 ru. 
• Core samples at 1285, 1415, 1490, 1620, 1700, 1720 and 1790 m a.s.l. showing 
snow depths of 4.2,5.0,5.1,6.3,4.3,5.6 and 4.6 m. 
• 147 snow depth soundings along about 20 km of profiles between 1290 and 1940 
m a.s.l. The probing conditions were fairly difficult at heights above 1500 m 
altitude. The snow depth varied between 3.5 and 6.5 ru. 
• Snow density was measured down to 1.5 m depth (SS at 5.0 m) at altitude 1490 ill 
a.s.l. This dens it y measurement was not sufficient for estimation of the snow 
density for the entire snow pack. Thus a snow dens it y measurement carried out at 
1500 m altitude (SS at 6.8 m) at Austdalsbreen (Chap. 6) is used.

Ablation was measured on 13th September. The net balance was measured directly at 
stakes in eight different locations between 1285 and 1940 m a.s.l. There was snow 
remaining over the entire glacier surface - from 0.2 m at the lower areas to more than 
2 m on the southwestem part of the glacier. Thus the snow line can be considered to 
lie below the altitude range of the glacier (i.e. below 1250 m a.s.l.). Between 5 and 45 
cm fresh snow had fallen. 
The second half of September and most of October was unusual warm in the 
Breheimen area, and subsequently melting continued after the ablation measurement. 
Ablation after 13th September, amounting to about 0.5 m w.eqv. between 1300 and 
1400 maltitude, and to ca. O.l m w.eqv. between 1400 and 1500 maltitude, is not 
included in the calculations. Instead it will be included in the winter balance 2001 
calculation.

The mass balance is calculated using the traditional method, which means the balance 
between two succes sive "summer surfaees". The ealculations are based on a glaeier 
map from 1996. 
Winter balanee 
The winter balanee ealculations are based on point measurements of snow depth 
(stakes, probings and core drillings) and a measurement of snow density at 
Austdalsbreen. 
The winter balance calculations are performed using two different methods. First, 
winter balanee is estimated by plotting measurements (water equivalents) on a 
diagram (Fig. 8-4). Based on a visual evaluation a eurve was drawn and a mean value 
for each 50 m height interval calculated. The entire glacier surfaee is weU represented 
with point measurements (Fig. 8-3). The winter balance was calculated as 2.3 ±0.2 m 
w.eqv., corresponding to a water volume of 30 ±3 mill. m3• Previous results are 2.2 m 
(1997), 1.7 m (1998) and 1.8 m w.eqv. (1999). 
The winter balance is als o calculated us ing a gridding method based on the spatial 
distribution ofthe snow depths (Fig. 8-3). Water equivalents for eaeh eell in a 100 x 
100 m grid are calculated and summarised. The result based on this method, whieh is 
a control of the traditional method, was also 2.3 m w.eqv. 
Figure 8-3 shows snow distribution over Harbardsbreen. 
Summer balanee 
The summer balanee was direetly measured and calculated at eight stakes, and 
increases from -1.1 m w.eqv. at stake 45 (1720 m a.s.l.) to -2.0 m w.eqv. at stake 20 
(1415 m a.s.l.). The dens it y of the remaining snow is estimated as 0.60 g/em3 , whilst 
the density of melted fim is estimated as 0.70 g/em3• Based on estimated density and 
stake measurements the summer balance was ealculated to be -1.5 ±0.3 m w.eqv., 
which is -20 ±4 mill. m3 of water. The result was -2.2 min 1999, -1.6 min 1998 and-
2.7 m w.eqv. in 1997. 
56 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee for 2000 was +0.8 ±0.4 m w.eqv., eorresponding a surplus of 
10 ±4 mill.m3 of water. This is the first year with a signifieant positive net balanee at 
Harbardsbreen sinee measurements started in 1997. Aeeording to Figure 8-4 the 
equilibrium line altitude is below the elevation range of the glacier, and thus the AAR 
is 100 %. 
The mass balanee results are shown in Table 8-1 and Figure 8-4. Historie mass 
balanee results sinee 1997 are presented in Figure 8-5.

8.2 Air temperature 
A station for automatically recording air temperature was set-up on the eastern side of 
Harbardsbreen (Fig. 8-1) in May 1997. Data is stored at the site and was transferred 
during field visits in February, April and September 2000. 
Air temperature results from Harbardsbreen (1320 m a.s.l.) for the period 1997-2000 
are presented in Table 8-2, and compared with corresponding measurements from 
Sognefjell station (1413 m a.s.l.), run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The 
values in the tab le indicate the daily mean air temperature for the "summer season" 
(defined as 1 st J une to 30th September).

1980-1988 (Sognefjell only) are also shown. 
The mean summer temperature in 2000 was 4.7 °e at Harhardshreen and 
approximately the same at Sognefjell (4.4 0C). The results from 1997 and 1998 are 
59 
also approximately equal for the two stations. The results for 1999, however, differ by 
2.0 cc. This difference probably indicate an erroneous value at Harbardsbreen in 
1999. 
8.3 lee-dam med lake 
Observations (Tab. 8-3) of the ice-dammed lake at the western side of the glaeier 
(altitude 1480 m a.s.l.) have been perfarmed since 1992. The observations suggest 
frequent jøkulhlaups (Kjøllmoen (ed.) 2000). 
During the past year (2000) the lake was photographed on 29th April, 27th July and 
13th September (Fig. 8-6). The observations showed water in the lake in July and 
September, whilst it was empty in April. During field visits in May, July and 
September 1999 the lake was empty. Hence, since the jøkulhlaup in winter 1998/99, 
the drainage channel was open for the rest of 1999. The time of channel closing is 
difficult 10 estimate, but it probably occured at the end of winter 2000 and befare the 
melting season started.

9 Storbreen (Liss M. Andreasen) 
Storbreen (61 °34' N, 8°8' E) is situated in the Leirdalen valley in the central part of 
Jotunheimen, a mountain area in central southem Norway (Fig. 9-1). The glacier has 
a total area of 5.4 km2 and ranges in altitude from l390 to 2090 m a.s.l. (Fig. 9-2). 
Mass balance measurements were initiated in 1949 and have been carried out 
continuous1y since then.

Location map showing Storbreen and other glaciers in Jotunheimen. Mass balance measurements 
are carried out on Storbreen and Hellstugubreen in the central part and on Gråsubreen in the 
eastern part of Jotunheimen. 
9.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Accumulation measurements were performed on 10th May. Five stakes at five 
different locations were visib1e. Snow depth was measured at 200 points a10ng 19 km 
ofprofi1es, covering almost all height intervals of the glacier (Figs. 9-2 and 9-3). The 
probing conditions were good, and last years summer surface was easy to identify. 
Snow depth varied between 1.8 and 7.1 m. Near1y 70 % of the soundings were 
between 3 and 5 meters (Fig. 9-3). Snow density was measured at stake 4 (1730 m 
a.s.l., Fig. 9.2) by sampling in a pit through the snow pack (3.8 m snow). Ablation 
measurements were carried out on 21 st September. Summer balance was calculated 
from stakes at 5 locations, net balance was calculated from stakes at 710cations.

Results 
Mass balanee was ealculated by using the stratigraphie method, also known as the 
traditional method. The results are shown in Table 9-1 and Figure 9-4. 
Winter balanee 
Winter ba1anee was ealculated from the soundings and the density measurement. The 
density was higher than normal at 0.48 g/em3• The dens it y profile was eonsidered 
representative for the rest of the glaeier. The winter balanee was eomputed as the 
mean of the soundings within eaeh 50-meter interval. The speeifie winter balanee was 
2.0 ±0.2 m w.eqv. This is 141 % of the mean for the period 1949-99. 
Summer balanee 
Summer balanee was ealcu1ated direet1y from stakes in five loeations and indireetly 
by net ba1anee at stakes in two other loeations. The density of the remaining snow 
was assumed to be 0.65 g/em3, based on measurements from previous years. The 
density of the melted iee was estimated to be 0.90 g/em3• The summer balanee was 
ealculated to -1.5 ±0.2 m w .eqv. This is 90 % of the mean for the period 1949-99. 
Net balanee 
The net balanee of Storbreen in 2000 was positive, 0.55 ± 0.3 m w.eqv. The 
equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 1650 m a.s.l., whieh eorresponds to an 
aeeumulation area ratio (AAR) of 76 % (Fig. 9-4). Out of the total 52 years of 
measurements, 20 of the years have had a positive net ba1ance, whi1e the rest have 
been negative (Fig. 9-5). Storbreen has experieneed a eumulative mass loss of -10.5 m 
w.eqv. between 1949 and 2000, or -0.20 m w.eqv. per year. Most of this mass loss 
oeeurred before 1980.

9.2 Front position change 
The front of Storbreen was covered by snow in September 2000. Therefore, it was not 
possible to measure the actual front position. The glacier had about the same position 
in 1999 as it had in 1988. Between 1900 and 1988 the glacier retreated more than 
1 km.

A new map of the glacier has been produced from aerial photographs taken in 1997. It 
replaces the old map from 1980 in the mass balance calculations. The 1997-map has 
been compared with older maps in order to quantify the glacier changes. The map 
itself and results are presented in chapter 16.4. 
10.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Accumulation measurements were carried out on 13th May. Fifteen stakes had 
survived the winter. Snow depth was measured at 139 points along 13 km of profiles 
covering most of the glacier. The probing conditions were good, and last years 
66 
summer surfaee was easy to identify over the whole glacier. The snow depth varied 
between 0.2 and 4.2 meters. 75 % of the measurements were between 2.0 and 3.5 
meters (Fig. 10-2). The snow density was measured by sampling in a pit through the 
total snow paek (3.2 m) at 1950 m a.s.l. Ablation measurements were made on 21st 
September. Stakes in fourteen loeations were measured. The loeation of stakes, 
density pit and sounding profiles are shown in Figure 10.1. 
Results 
The mass balanee was ealculated using the stratigraphie method, also known as the 
traditional method. The results are presented in Table 10-1 and Figure 10-3. 
Winter ba/ance 
The ealculation of winter balanee was based on the soundings and the density 
measurement that is eonsidered to be representative for the rest of the glacier. The 
mean snow density was higher than usual at 0.49 g em3• The winter balanee was 
eomputed as the mean of the soundings within eaeh 50-meter interval. Winter balanee 
was ealeulated to 1.3 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which was 112 % of the mean for the period 
1962-99.

Summer ba/ance 
The summer balanee was ealeulated from 14 stakes. The density of the remaining 
snow was assumed to be 0.65 glem3 based on the measurement in May and on 
previous years experienee. The density of the melting ice was estimated to be 0.9 
glem3• The summer balanee was ealeulated as -1.1 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which is 86 % of 
the mean value for the entire observation period. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee of Hellstugubreen 2000 was positive, 0.2 ± 0.3 m w.eqv. This is the 
twelfth year with a positive mass balanee in the total 39 years of measurements. The 
equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 1840 m a.s.l. and the AAR was 63 % (Fig. 10-3). 
Sinee 1962 the glacier has had a deficit amounting to 10.3 m w.eqv. and the mean 
annual net balanee has been --Q.26 m w.eqv. (Fig. 10-4).

10.2 Front position change 
Hellstugubreen had no net change in front position between September 1999 and 
September 2000. 
The front position measurements started in 1901 when øyen erected a cairn in front 
of the glacier. The glacier has retreated a total of 1000 m since then or, in other 
words, the average annual retreat has been 10 m (Fig. 10-5). Since 1990 the retreat 
has been about 60 meters.

11 Gråsubreen (LissM.Andreassen) 
Gråsubreen (61 °39' N, 8°37'E) is located in the eastem part of the Jotunheimen 
mountain area in southem Norway (Fig. 9-1). The glacier covers an area of 2.2 km2 
and ranges in elevation from 1830 to 2290 m a.s.l. (Fig. Il-l). Annual mass balance 
measurements began in 1962 and have continued annually since then. Gråsubreen is a 
polythermal glacier. Superimposed ice occurs in the central parts of the glacier where 
snowdrift causes a relatively tbin snow pack, and superimposed ice may be 
responsible for up to 8 % of the total accumulation in these areas.

11.1 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Accumulation measurements were carried out on 15 th May. Stakes in 18 locations 
were measured. 163 snow depth measurements were made along 14 km of profiles, 
covering most of the glacier (Fig. 11-1). The probing conditions were good, and last 
years summer surface was easy to identify over the entire glacier. Snow depth varied 
between O and 3.7 m. 70 % of the soundings was between 1.0 and 2.5 m. The snow 
70 
density was measured at 2180 m a.s.l. in a snow pit dug down to the last summer's 
surface (2.5 m snow). Ablation measurements were carried out on 21 ,( September. 
Stakes in 18 locations were measured. 
Results 
Winter ba/ance 
Winter balanee was calculated from the soundings and the density measurement. The 
density measurement was considered representative for the whole glaeier. The density 
was higher than normal at O.SO g/cm3 . The winter balanee was calculated as the mean 
of the soundings at 50-m altitude intervals. The stake recordings showed that between 
5 and 30 cm of superimposed ice had formed at six stake locations. Therefore, in this 
area (total of 31 soundings) an interpolated amount of superimposed ice was added to 
each sounding before calculating the winter balanee in each interval. The specific 
winter balanee was 0.87 m w.eqv. 
Since the snow distribution at Gråsubreen varies appreciably due to wind drift, the 
winter balanee was also calculated in a geographie information system (GIS) using 
ArclInfo software. All soundings were digitised. The snow depth measurement was 
then converted to water equivalent. Finally, winter balanee was calculated by 
interpolating the measurements. The mean winter balanee was almost the same using 
this method, 0.86 m w.eqv. Thus, the winter balanee calculated from both methods 
was rounded to 0.9 ±0.2 m w.eqv. 
Summer ba/ance 
Summer balanee was calculated based on direct measurements of stakes in 15 
locations. The density of the remaining snow was assumed to be 0.65 g/cm3, based on 
the density measurement in May and previous years experience. The density of the 
melted ice was estimated to be 0.90 glem3 • The resulting summer balanee was -0.9 
±0.2 m w.eqv. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee of Gråsubreen 2000 was negative, -0.05 ± 0.3 m w.eqv. Since 1962 
the cumulative net balanee was -9.9 m w.eqv. Most of this mass loss occurred in the 
first 20-25 years of measurements. Since 1988 the glacier has been more or less in 
balanee (Fig 10-3). The volurne change of the glacier for the period 1984-1997 has 
been calculated by map comparison and is described in chapter 16.5.

12 Svartishei breen (Hallgeir Elvehøy) 
Svartisheibreen (660 35' N, 130 45' E) is located southwest of the western Svartisen 
ieeeap. It has an area of 5.5 km2 and drains to the Glomåga river and lake Langvatnet. 
The glaeier ranges from 1530 m a.s.1. at its highest elevation down to 774 m a.s .1. at 
proglaciallake Heivatn into which the glaeier calves (Fig. 12-1). The glaeier has been 
monitored in connection with a planned hydropower development (Kennett et al. 
1997). In 1995 the monitoring programme was reduced to observations of the lake 
level in Heiavatn in order to see if jøkulhlaups occur, and observations of the 
snowline altitude in order to calculate annual net balance.

Changes in surface elevation between 12th August 1995 and 21 st September 2000 (e). A small 
proportion of the change (about 1 m) is probably due to melting after 21 st September in 1995. The 
pre-Iowering lake level in Lake Heiavatnet is 774 m a.s.1. Glacier contour lines up to 900 m a.s.1. are 
shown. 
12.1 Observations 2000 
Heiavatnet 
Lake Heiavatnet was observed and photographs taken on 21 st September 2000. The 
river from the lake was dry, and the lake level was 768 m a.s.l., 6 m below normal. 
The lake level after the jøkulhlaup in April 1991 was 766.7 m a.s.l., after which the 
water remained 10w during most of the following winter (Kjøllmoen & Kennett 
1995). Comparing photographs taken on 22nd September 1999 and 2 1 st September 
2000 shows that the water level was higher at some point during this period, since 
icebergs that pro babl y were too large to melt away during one year were present in 
1999 and not in 2000. Thus the lake has probably been filled up so that the icebergs 
could drift off before the lake level was lowered again during the period from 
September 1999 to September 2000. 
74 
25500 
Equilibrium line altitude 
No fresh snow was present on 21 st September. Based on visual determination of the 
snow line in the photographs taken from a helicopter, the equilibrium line altitude 
(ELA) was estimated as 950 ±1O m a.s.l. 
Elevation profiling 
The fixed point SVAlOl (Fig. 12-1) was used to measure the surface elevation. The 
previously used fixed point, SV Al 03, was used as a reference point. The point 
sv A101 provides a better view of the critical part of the glacier where the lake is 
drained. The change of observation point may cause a shift in reported elevations. 
Eighteen points on the surface of the glacier were measured (Fig. 12-1); seven points 
along the glacier front, seven in the dam area, and three in an area at an elevation of 
810 m a.s.l. 
12.2 Results 
Changes in ice thickness 
Point observations from 2000 are not directly comparable with observations from 
1998 and 1999, as the points are not spatially co-located. Thus all points are 
compared to the contour lines constructed from the aerial photographs acquired on 
12th August 1995 (Fig. 12-1). The western part of the tongue has been afloat for 
severai years. All the point elevations along the front, except ane, are lower than the 
lake level in Lake Heiavatnet (774 m a.s.l.), which indicates that the part of the 
tongue that is floating has become larger since 1999. In 1999 only points comparable 
to the western two points in 2000 had elevations lower than normal lake level. 
The surface was lower in 2000 than in the previous twa years in the area where the 
glacier dams the lake. Thus the observations indicate that the glacier tongue is 
thinning. This is probably due to increased ice velocity towards the lake as a res ult of 
increased lake area and water depth at the glacier margin. 
Changes in front position in Lake Heiavatnet 
The front position in 2000 was compared with the observations from 1999. Definition 
of the western part of the glacier terminus was difficult due to crevasses and an 
increase in the area of the glacier front that is floating. There were only small changes 
in the eastern and central part of the front. Compared to the map from 1995 there was 
minor retreat in the eastern part of the glacier front. 
Net balanee 2000 
The net balance of Svartisheibreen was estimated using twa different methods; one 
using the observed net balance on Engabreen (bn=1.5 ±0.3 m w.eqv.), and the other 
using the observed ELA at Svartisheibreen (950 ±10 m a.s.l.). Both methods are 
based on measurements of the mass balance of Svartisheibreen carried out between 
75 
1988 and 1994 (see Figs. 12-2 and 12-3). The model for estimating the net balance 
based on ELA has been changed from that used previously (Fig. 12-3). This was done 
because the 1989 net balance was much higher than in 1992 and 1993, whi1e the ELA 
of these years were quite similar 
The net balance was + 1.0 m w.eqv. based on the Engabreen net balance, and +0.4 m 
w.eqv. based on the ELA of Svartisheibreen. Combining these results gives an 
estimate of net balance of 0.7±0.4 m w.eqv. The results for the period 1995-2000 are 
listed in Table 12-1.

Cumulative specific net balanee of Svartisheibreen for the period 1969-2000. Estimated net balanee 
(thin solid line) is modelled from net balanee on Engabreen (1969-87), and from the equilibrium line 
altitude on Svartisheibreen and net balanee of Engabreen (1995-2000). Cumulative net balanee 
reduced by 0.25 m w.eqv. is also shown (dashed line). 
77 
modelled mass balanee figures were too high (Kjøllmoen, 2000). An annual under 
estimate of the summer balanee in the order of 0.25 m w.eqv. per year most probably 
caused this. The adjusted cumulative net balanee is shown in Figure 12-4. 
Future scenarios 
Projecting these changes into the near future, we suggest that the lower part of the 
glacier will become thinner and that the lake will increase in volume. At some point, 
the subglacial drainage tunnel will not close during the winter, and lake Heiavatnet 
wil1 drain permanently under the glacier towards Slukta. Lowering of the lake leve! 
will probably reduce or terminate the thinning of the glaeier. If the glaeier continues 
to thin, the lake will probably start draining along lower drainage routes. Based on a 
bottom topography map by Kjøllmoen & Kennett (1995) a rock threshold at 
720 ±20 m a.s.1. is the lower limit for the lake level.

13 Eng a b ree n (Hallgeir Elvehøy and Miriam Jackson) 
Engabreen (66°40'N, 13°45'E) is a 38 km2 northwestern outlet from the western 
Svartisen icecap. It covers an altitude range from 1594 m a.s.l. (at Snøtind) down to 
7 m a.s.l. (at Engabrevatnet), as shown in Figure 13-1. Mass balance measurements 
have been performed annually since 1970.

Winter accumulation measurements were carried out between 23rd and 27 th May, as 
weU as a provisional measurement on 12th April. The locations of stakes and towers, 
density pit, core samples and sounding profiles are shown in Figure 13-1. The 
calculation of the winter balance is based on: 
• Direct measurements at stake 17 (300 m a.s.l.), and towers T2l (1185 m a.s.l.), 
T101 (1320 m a.s.l.) and T105 (1345 m a.s.l.) giving 0.0,5.7, 7.4 and 7.6 m of 
snow. 1.4 m of ice had melted at stake 17 since 23rd September 1999. 
79 
• Core samples taken on 12th April at 1060 m a.s.1. (stake 37), 1195 m a.s.l. (stake 
16), and 1245 m a.s.l. (stake 40) giving 6.1,6.1 and 7.3 m of snow, respeetively. 
In May, snow depth at these stakes was reeorded as 5.6, 6.0 and 6.9 metres. 
• Core samples eolleeted between 23rd and 27th May 1015 m a.s.l. (stake 35), 1330 
m a.s.l. (stake 90) and 1400 m a.s.1. (stake 143) gave 3.7,6.1 and 7.3 m of snow. 
• Snow density was measured to a depth of 3.5 mat 1015 m a.s.1. (stake 35) and to 
7.2 mat 1400 m a.s.l. (stake 143). Mean snow densities were 0.48 and 
0.49 g/em3• 
• 142 snow depth soundings along approximately 35 km of profiles. 21 soundings 
along the profiles from tower T105 to stake 40 to tower T21 were earrled out on 
12th April. These observations were eorreeted for ehanges between 12th April and 
25th May as observed at T105, stake 40 and T21. The snow depth was between 6 
and 8 min above 1200 m a.s.l., and 4 to 6 m between 950 and 1200 m a.s.l. 
• The transient snow line (TSL) on 25th May in the icefall was at about 500 m a.s.l. 
Summer ablation measurements were earried out between 20th and 22nd September. At 
that time no fresh snow had fallen on the glaeier. The TSL was observed at about 
1000 m a.s.l. The net balanee was observed at 10 positions in the elevation range of 
300 to 1400 m a.s.1. About 5 m of snow was left at stakes 143, T105 and T101, and 
about 2 ru at the stakes at 1060 ru a.s.1. All the snow and 0.25 m fim had melted at the 
stake at 1015 m a.s.l. At the glader tongue (300 m a.s.l.) 6.55 m of iee had melted 
during the summer. During the eourse of the summer 2-4 m of snow melted at the 
stakes on the upper plateau. At T23 on Storglombreen glaeier (1235 m a.s.l.) the 
mean snow density of the top 2.0 m was 0.59 glem3• At this loeation 3.5 m of snow 
remained from the previous winter. 
Results 
The mass balanee is ealeulated using the traditional method (also ealled the 
stratigraphic method), whieh reports the balanee between two sueeessive "summer 
surfaees". The ealculations are performed using a map from 1968 and drainage 
divides ealculated from bottom topography and ice thickness (Kennett & Elvehøy, 
1995). 
Winter ba/ance 
The ealeulations of winter balanee are based on point measurements of snow depth 
(towers, probing and eore drillings) and on measurement of snow density at two 
loeations (see Fig. 13-1). 
Density profiles were ruodelled from the snow density measured 1400 m a.s.l. and 
1015 m a.s.l. Using these ruodels, the mean snow density for the upper 5 m of snow 
was 0.48 g/em3 (1015 m a.s.l.) and 0.49 g/em3 (1400 m a.s.l.). The model for 1015 m 
altitude is used in the areas below 1200 m a.s.l., whilst the model for 
1400 m altitude is used in the areas above 1200 m a.s.l. 
80 
The winter balanee calculations are performed using two different methods. In the 
first method, specific winter balanee calculated from the altitudinal distribution of the 
winter balance. Point values of the snow water equivalent (SWE) is plotted against 
altitude in a diagram. Based on visual evaluation a curve is drawn and a mean value 
for each 100 m height interval is estimated (Fig. 13-3). No snow depth observations 
were carried out below 950 m a.s.l. and the winter balanee is interpolated based on 
the observed TSL at 500 m a.s.l. and the observed negative winter balanee at stake 17 
(300 m a.s.l.). Based on this altitudinal distribution curve, the winter balanee was 
2.8 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which gives a volurne of 105 ±8 mill. m3 of water. This is 93 % of 
the mean value for the period from 1970-1999 (3.02 m w.eqv.), and 88 % of the mean 
value for the 5-year period 1995-1999. 
The second method ca1culates the winter balanee using a gridding method based on 
the spatial distribution of the snow depth measurements (Fig. 13-1). Kriging-
interpolation is used, and the result based on this method, which is a control of the 
traditional method, shows a winter balanee of 3.0 m w.eqv. The results from the two 
methods are thus comparable. A map illustrating the snow distribution is shown in 
Figure 13-2. 
Summer ba/ance 
The summer balanee was measured and ca1culated directly at nine stakes and towers 
between 300 and 1400 m a.s.l. Based on measurements and estimates of stakes and 
snow density the summer balanee was calculated to be -1.3 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which is 
equal to a volurne of -48 ±8x106 m3 water. The result is 56 % of the average for the 
period 1962-1999, and 54 % of the average for the 5-year period 1995-1999. This is 
the second largest summer balanee observed, second to the -1.2 m w.eqv. observed 
in 1997. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee of Engabreen for 2000 was ca1culated as + 1.5 ±0.3 m w.eqv., which 
means a surplus volurne of 57 ±15 mill. m3 water. The mean value for the period 
1970-1999 is +0.76 m w.eqv., and for the period 1995-1999 it is +0.79 m w.eqv. The 
diagram in Figure 13-3 indicates that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 
970 m a.s.l., which is in accordance with the observed TSL at about 1000 m a.s.l. 
Eighty-nine % of the glaeier area (AAR) is located above the ELA. 
The mass balanee results are shown in Table 13-1 and Figure 13-3. Historie mass 
balanee results since 1970 are presented in Figure 13-4.

13.2 Front position change 
Changes in front position are observed from fixed points along a line which is aligned 
along the fIow direction of the glacier at the middle of the glacier front, as well as 
where the river exits the glacier. The glacier front melted so that the front position 
was 10 m further back on 21 st September 2000 compared with its position on 23rd 
September 1999. However, since the current advance started in 1991, the glacier front 
has advanced a total of 190 m, and the terminus is now at the same position as in 
1950. The terminus is now in contact with the delta where the river enters the lake. 
13.3 Svartisen subglacial laboratory 
Svartisen subglaciallaboratory is a unique facility situated under Engabreen glacier. 
It allows direct access to the bed of the glacier for the purposes of measuring sub-
glacial parameters and performing experiments on the ice. 
Severalload cells have been installed at the bed of the glacier for measuring pressure 
variations and examining the correlation of pressure with such parameters as sub-
glacial discharge, precipitation at the surface etc. In 2000 there were six load cells 
installed, and these successfully recorded between 1st January and 27th April and 
between 8th June and 20th October. 
No research activities took place in the laboratory in 2000, but there was a 
preliminary visit by NealIverson of Iowa State University and Tom Hooyer of 
Wisconsin Geological Survey, as weU as two employees of NVE. The visit took 
place in late October and involved getting equipment ready for a large international 
project the following spring involving five different institutions, and assembling 
moraine material that could be used in an experiment to be performed then. Because 
of unusual conditions in the tunnel system, it was not possible to access the opening 
to the base of the glacier. 
The fIrst of what will be a series of biennial reports was released in 2000. This is 
Document 14 in NVE's document series and is entitled simply 'Svartisen Subglacial 
Laboratory' .

14 Storglombreen (HallgeirElvehøy) 
Storglombreen (66°41'N, 14°00'E) is the largest outlet from the Svartisen ieeeap. It 
covers an area of 62.4 km2 and drains the western Svartisen ice cap to Lake 
Storglomvatnet (Fig. 14-1). Most of its area is located between 900 and 1300 m a.s.l. 
Three outlet glaciers calves into the lake. Mass balance measurements were carried 
out during the four years from 1985 to 1988. 
Lake Storglomvatnet is a reservoir for the Svartisen hydropower facility. The latest 
regulation of its outflow was completed in 1999. An assessment of the inflow to 
Storglomvatn reservoir show ed that during the observation period 1985-1988 
observations at Engabreen were not reliable as a proxy for the mass balanee of 
Storglombreen (Engeset, 1999). Thus another 5-year observation programme, based 
on a reduced set of observation points, was initiated in 2000 (Fig. 14-1).

14.1 Mass balanee 1985-1988 and a new observation 
network 
Mass balanee 1985-1988 
During the period 1985-1988 an extensive snow depth network was used for the 
winter balanee measurements, covering about 300 samples above 1000 m a.s.l. 
A snow density profile was collected from one point on Storglombreen (stake 3, 
Fig. 14.1) or Engabreen. Summer balanee was observed at 5-10 stakes between 1000 
and 1300 m a.s.l. Maps of winter and summer balanee distributions were made based 
on these point measurements and values extrapolated for the areas below 1000 m 
a.s.l. Average values for each 100-m elevation interval were ca1culated using a 
planimeter on the map. The contribution of calving and avalanches from the terminus 
was estimated roughly without considering the changes in front position, ice thickness 
and ice velocity at the terminus. lee calving contributed 3 - 6 % of the total summer 
balanee in the 1985-1988 period. 
A map from 1968 was used for ca1culation of the mass balance. The elevation-area 
distribution used for the period 1985-1988 was based on drainage boundaries drawn 
from the map of 1968. The drainage divides for Storglombreen has been ca1culated 
from bottom topography, and ice thickness (Kennett & Elvehøy, 1995). This analysis 
gave an area of 62.4 km2 for Storglombreen, which is 5 % more than the estimate of 
59.2 km:! based on the 1968 maps. The differenee translated into specific summer and 
winter mass balanee is about +1 %, which is much lower than the assumed 
uncertainty of the mass balanee observations. 
Simplified observation network 2000 
Snow depth and stake observations from the period 1985-1988 were assessed. A 
representative set of depth sounding profiles and stake positions was selected, and 
used as the basis for a reduced observation network (Fig. 14-1). The criteria applied 
for the selection of sounding profiles were that the profile was used in the period 
1985-1988, and that the se1ected profil es are representative for all soundings and the 
estimated mean value for the entire glaeier area (as compared to the winter balanee 
maps). The selection of stake positions required that the selected stakes were us ed in 
the period 1985-1988 and represents the mean specific summer balanee for the entire 
glaeier. An additional requirement was that two people could carry out all 
observations (depth soundings, one vertical dens it y profile, and 2-3 stakes) during one 
day of fieldwork. 
Figure 14-2 shows a linear regression between mean water equivalent for all snow 
depth points along the profiles (which in 1985-1988 corresponded to those shown in 
Fig. 14-1), and specific winter balanee for the entire glaeier. Linear regression was 
performed between summer balanee at stake 3 and specific summer balanee for the 
entire glaeier. The data used for the regression analysis is shown in Table 14-1.

14.2 Mass balanee 2000 
Field work 
Winter aeeumulation measurements were earried out on 23rd and 24th May. The 
loeations of stakes, dens it y pit, eore samples and sounding profiles are shown in 
Figure 14-1. The ealculation of the winter balanee is bas ed on: 
• 
• 
• 
Core samples taken at 1005 m a.s.l. (stake l), 1125 m a.s.l. (stake 3), and 1235 m 
a.s.l. (tower T23) giving 3.8, 5.6, and 6.5 m of snow. 
Snow density measured to a depth of 5.3 mat 1125 m a.s.l. (stake 3). Mean snow 
dens it y was 0.51 g/em3• 
71 snow depth soundings along approximately 18 km of profiles in the area 
loeated between 1000 and 1300 m a.s.l. Most observations showed between 5 and 
7 m of snow, and the summer surfaee was generally well defined. 
Summer ablation measurements were earried out between 20th and 220d September. At 
that time no fresh snow had fallen on the glaeier. The transient snow line (TSL) was 
observed at about 1000 m a.s.l. The net balanee was observed at three positions, at 
1005, 1125 and 1235 m a.s.l. At T23 (1235 m a.s.l.) the mean snow density of the top 
2.0 m was 0.59 g/em3• At this loeation 3.5 m of snow remained from the previous 
winter. At stake l and 3 about 0.4 and 2.6 m snow remained, respeetively. During the 
eourse of the summer 3-3.5 m of snow had melted at these stakes. 
Results 
The mass balanee is ealculated using the traditional method (also ealled the 
stratigraphie method), whieh reports the balanee between two sueeessive "summer 
surfaees" (SS). The ealculations are performed using a map from 1968 and drainage 
divides ea1culated from bottom topography and iee thiekness (Kennett & Elvehøy, 
1995). 
The mass balanee was also ea1culated using the regression equations established from 
the eommon observation period 1985-1988 (Fig. 14-2). 
Winter balanee 
The ealculations of winter balanee are bas ed on point measurements of snow depth 
(towers, probing and eore drillings) and measurements of snow dens it y at one 
loeation (Fig. 14-1). A water equivalent profile was modelled from the snow density 
measurements at stake 3. Aeeording to this model, the mean snow dens it y for the 
upper 5 m of snow was 0.51 g/em3• This model is used to eonvert all snow depth 
observations to water equivalent values. 
The speeifie winter balanee is ealculated from the altitudinal distribution of the winter 
balanee. Point values of the snow water equivalent is plotted against altitude. 
A representative eurve is drawn based on the mean value in eaeh 100-m elevation 
interval, the observed altitude of the transient snow line (about 1040 m a.s.l.) and the 
88 
summer balanee ca1culated at stake 1.00 (1005 m a.s.l., bs = -1.6 m w.eqv.) 
(Fig. 14-3). As snow depth was observed between 1000-1300 m a.s.l. only, the mean 
balanee curve for the period 1985-1988 is used to guide the curve below 1000 m a.s.l. 
and above 1300 m a.s.l. Based on this method, the ca1culated winter balanee was 
2.6 ±0.2 m w.eqv., which corresponds to a volurne of 170 mill. m3 of water. 
The winter balanee is shown in Figure 14-3 and Table 14-2. 
The winter balanee was calculated using the regression equation defined in Figure 
14-2 also. The mean water equivalent for 71 points along the profile shown in Figure 
14-1 was 2.98 m, which gives a specific winter balanee for Storglombreen of 2.54 m. 
This implies that the calculated winter balanee for 2000 is comparable to the winter 
balances calculated for 1985-88. The winter balanee for 2000 is 123 % of the 1985-88 
mean and the highest ever recorded at Storglombreen,. 
Summer ba/ance 
The summer balanee was measured and ca1culated directly at three positions (1005, 
1125 and 1235 m a.s.l.) on Storglombreen. Stakes T21 (1190 m a.s.l.), 40-00 (1250 
a.s.l.) and T105 (1345 m a.s.l.) on Engabreen are located very close to the ice divide 
(Fig. 14-1) and are considered to be representative for Storglombreen too. The 
summer balanee curve was drawn based on these six point measurements with 
support of the mean balanee curve for the period 1985-1988 (Fig. 14-3). 
The contribution from calving and ice avalanches is estimated, as it was for the period 
1985-1988. This contribution totals -7 mill. m3 water, based on an estimated total 
terminus length of 1.6 km, a mean terminus height of 50 m and a glaeier velocity of 
100 mla. 
The total summer balance, including the calving contribution, totals 
-100 ±20 mill. m3 water, which is equal to a specific balanee of -1.6 ±0.3 m w.eqv. 
This is the lowest mass loss recorded, and is only 56 % of the average summer 
balanee for the period 1985-1988. 
The summer balanee was also ca1culated with the regression equation shown in 
Figure 14-2. The summer balanee at stake 3 was -1.3 m w.eqv, which gives a specific 
summer balanee excluding calving for Storglombreen of -1.58 m w.eqv., and -1,70 m 
w.eqv. when calving is included. This implies that the ca1culated summer balanee for 
2000 is comparable to the summer balances ca1culated for 1985-88. 
Net ba/ance 
The net balanee of Storglombreen for 2000 was + 1.1 ±0.3 m w.eqv., which is a 
surplus volurne of70 ±20 mill. m3 water. The mean value for 1985-1989 was 
-0.75 m w.eqv. Figure 14-4 indicates that the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 
1000 m a.s.l., which is marginally lower than the observed TSL at about 1040 m a.s.l. 
Based on the estimated ELA, the accumulation area ratio (AAR) is 86 %. 
The mass balanee results are shown in Table 14-2 and Figure 14-3. The results from 
2000 are compared to mass balanee results for the period 1985-1988 in Figure 14-4.

14.2 Front position change 
2000 
Storglombreen has three distinet front segments (here named South, Middle and 
North Storglombreen) that calve into the Storglomvatnet reservoir (Fig 14-5). The 
reservoir has been modified severai times, and before the most recent changes in 
1989, Middle and North Storglombreen calved into the reservoir. Observation of the 
front position changes began in autumn 2000, and will be carried out in order to 
document changes associated with changes in water leve1 of the reservoir. The front 
of the calving outlet from glacier Tretten-null-to-breen is observed also (Fig. 14-5). 
Fixed point 
The terminus of South Storglombreen reaches the lake only when the water level is at 
its highest at 585 m a.s.l. Therefore it was excluded from the observation programme. 
The other three outlets could be measured using one fixed point, STOlOl (Fig. 14-5). 
STOlOl was positioned using three Ashtech Z-Surveyor two-phase GPS receivers. 
The GPS receivers were used to determine vectors from two fixed points at Bautaen 
and Terskaldfjellet (Fig. 14-1). Each vector was GPS-Iogged for 87 minutes, which 
gave an error of 0.07 m horizontally and 0.11 m vertically.

Front position changes of the termines that calve into the Storglomvatnet reservoir. 
Front position observations 2000 
The terminus position was measured on 20th September from STO 10 1 using 
Terskaldfjellet as a reference point (Fig. 14-5). A Geodimeter total station and 8 
reflectors located in the helicopter window were used. The terminus was positioned 
by observing the reflectors as the helicopter touched the ice edge, if possible, along 
the front perimeter. The' accuracy of this method depends on the geometry of the 
glaeier front and the flight conditions, and such measurements may therefore be 
relatively uncertain. Horizontal uncertainty of individual points is estimated to be less 
than ±2 m, while vertical uncertainty is much less when the helicopter touches the 
ground. Figure 14-5 shows the observations, and the observed terminus position in 
1985 and 1968. At the time of the field visit, the reservoir was at its highest level, 
585 m a.s.l. 
Tretten-null-to-breen 
The 200 m long terminus was defined by measuring three points. There are on ly small 
changes in front position between 1968, 1985 and 2000. The glaeier terminated on 
92 
dry land in 1968 and 1985. The glacier tongue narrowed in this period, which 
suggests a negative volume change. The front widened and retreated about 25 m 
between 1985 and 2000. The glaeier most probably has had a mass surplus, but the 
front has retreated due to calving caused by the regulation of the reservoir. 
North Storglombreen 
The 400 m long terminus was defined by measuring three points. Little change has 
been recorded between 1968 and 1985, but the front became narrower during this 
period, which suggests a negative volume change. The front retreated about 200 m 
between 1985 and 200, and the part of the front that terminates in the lake became 
much narrower. The glaeier has become much thinner on the north side, which may 
be a dynamic response to an increase in the water level of the reservoir. 
Middle Storglombreen 
The terminus was defined by measuring five points. The three southem points define 
the width of the glaeier in water (350 m), while the northem part terrninates on 
ground. Little change was been recorded between 1968 and 1985, but the front 
retreated about 300 m between 1985 and 2000. 
South Storglombreen 
The terminus was located just at the water, but no precise measurements were made. 
Before the last modification of the reservoir capacity, this part of the glader 
terminated on ground. Between 1968 and 1985 the glaeier retreated 90 m indicating a 
negative volume change for this period. Between 1985 and 2000 the glacier retreated 
another 80 m, which may be caused by the increased water level in the reservoir.

15 Langfjordjøkelen (BjarneKjøllmoen) 
Langfjordjøkelen (70olO'N, 21 0 45'E) is a plateau glaeier situated on the border of 
Troms and Finnmark counties, approx. 60 km north west of Alta. It has an area of 
about 8.4 km2 (1994), and ofthis 3.7 km2 drains eastward to the Andrevann lake 
(Fig. IS-l). The investigations are performed on this east facing part, ranging from 
280 to 1050 m a.s.l. 
The glaciological investigations in 2000 inc1ude mass balance, change in front 
position and air temperature measurements. Langfjordjøkelen has been the subject of 
mass balanee measurements since 1989 except during 1994 and 1995. The winter and 
summer balances for these two years are estimated based on meteorological 
observations (Kjøllmoen 1999). 
Figure 15-1 
The mass balanee measurements are performed at the east-facing outlet, which drains to 
Andrevann lake (255 m a.s.I.). A station for measuring air temperature measurings is located 
between the glaeier terminus and the inlet of Andrevann. The solid line roughly indicates the 
drainage basin of Langfjordjøkelen.

Results 
The mass balanee is ca1culated using the traditional method, which means the balanee 
between two successive "summer surfaces". The calculations are based on a glaeier 
map from 1994. 
Winter ba/ance 
The calculations of winter balanee are based on severai point measurements of snow 
depth (stakes, probings and core drillings) and on one snow density measurement. 
A dens it y profile was modelled from the snow density measurement at 895 m 
altitude. The mean snow density of 4.7 m snow was 0.50 g/cm3• 
The winter balanee calculations are performed using two different methods. First, the 
winter balanee is estimated by plotting the measurements (water equivalents) in a 
diagram (Fig. 15-4). Based on a visual evaluation a curve was drawn and a mean 
value for each 100 m height interval was estimated. The ca1cu1ations showa winter 
balanee of 2.5 ±0.2 m w.eqv. , corresponding to a water volume of 9 ±1 mill. m3. The 
result is 113 % of the mean value for the period 1989-99 (including 1994 and 1995).

The winter balanee is also ca1culated using a gridding method based on the spatial 
distribution of the snow depth measurements (15-3). Water equivalents for each cell 
96 
531000 
in a 100 x 100 m grid are ea1culated and summarised. This ea1culation gives the same 
result as the traditional method, 2.5 m w.eqv. 
Summer balanee 
The density of the remaining snow is empirieally estimated as 0.60 g/em3• The 
density of melted flm is assumed to be 0.70 glem3, whilst the density of iee that sinee 
melted is 0.90 glem3• 
The summer balanee was measured and ealeulated at five stakes, and inereases from 
-2.4 m w.eqv. in the upper parts of the glacier (1050 m a.s.l.) to -4.6 m down on the 
tongue (475 moh.). Based on estimated density and stake measurements, the summer 
balanee was ea1culated to be -3.1 ±0.3 m w.eqv., whieh is -11 ±1 mill. m3 0fwater. 
The result is 122 % of the average for 1989-99. 
Net balanee 
Henee, the net balanee at Langfjordjøkelen for 2000 was -0.6 ±0.4 m w.eqv., whieh 
means a deficit of2 ±1 mill. m3 of water (Tab. 15-1). Figure 15-4 indicates that the 
equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 860 m a.s.l., which is about 130 m higher than 
during a year when the glacier is in balanee. The Aeeumulation Area Ratio (AAR) 
was44 %. 
Sinee the mass balanee measurements started in 1989 there have been only two years 
with a slight positive net balanee (1992 and 1993, besides a modelled surplus in 
1995), (Fig. 15-5). The glaeier was almost in balanee during two separate years (1991 
and 1996), whilst a negative balanee oeeured in six separate years (besides a 
modelled deficit in 1994). The mean net balanee for the period 1989-1999 (modelled 
values inc1uded) is -0.33 m w.eqv. The aeeumulated negative net balanee sinee 1989 
is about 4 m w.eqv., corresponding to about 15 mill. m3 of water (Fig. 15-5).

Mass balance at Langfjordjøkelen during the period 1989-2000. The accumulated deficit amounts to 
4.2 m water equivalents. 
15.2 Front position change 
Studies of older maps and air photos show that the eastfacing outlet of 
Langfjordjøkelen has receded about 750 m since 1966 (Kjøllmoen 2000). The mean 
annua! retreat during this period was 23 metres per year. 
Annua! measurements of the change in front position were initiated in 1998. The 
measurements are performed using traditional methods. The distance from the glacier 
98 
4 
terminus to marked fix points is measured using measuring tape. To achieve 
comparable results the measurements are always performed in the autumn. 
The measurements in autumn 1998, 1999 and 2000 show continued retreat of the 
glacier front. During the latest period (25th September 1999 to Il th October 2000) the 
frontal retreat was 12 m, and since l st October 1998 the accumulated recession is 
about 50 metres. 
15.3 Air temperature 
A station for automatically recording air temperature was initiated in August 1997. 
The recording station (No. 211.4, 270 m a.s.l.) is located by the glacier stream 
between the glacier terminus and Andrevann (Fig. 15-1). 
Recorded air temperature data from Langfjordjøkelen for the period 1998-2000 are 
presented in Table 15-2. The results are compared with corresponding measurements 
from Nordstraum weather station (No. 92350, 6 m a.s.l.) in Kvænangen (ca. 35 km 
south of Langfjordjøkelen), operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The 
values in the table give the daily mean air temperature for the "summer season" 
(defined as 1 st J une to 30th September).

16 Volume change 
(Liss M. Andreassen and Hallgeir Elvehøy) 
NVE has acquired vertical aerial photographs of glaciers in Norway for several 
decades. Detailed maps or digital terrain models (DTMs) have been made of selected 
glaciers from the aerial photographs. Multiple models of a glacier have been used to 
caIculate changes in glacier volume and area for the interval between mappings. 
Analyses and results from six different glaciers in Norway are presented in this 
chapter. 
16.1 Methods 
The geodetic (also called cartographic) method calculates total volume change by 
comparison of topographic maps from different years. The data processing involves 
construction of digital terrain models (DTM) from the topographic data in a 
Geographical Information System (GIS). The thickness change is calculated by 
subtracting the DTMs. This gives a grid with the altitude differences in glacier ice, 
fim and partly snow. To compare this result with the volume change calculated from 
other methods, the altitude difference needs to be converted to the differenee in water 
equivalents by multiplying the grid with the dens it y of ice, usually 900 kg/m3• We 
then assume that the glacier is in steady-state and that the density profile from the 
surface to the firn-ice transition is unchanged between mappings. The volume change 
values should also be modified for the additional melting that occurs from the date of 
photography to the end of the season when comparing with traditional mass balance 
measurements. 
The accuracy of the final result is affected by several factors, such as errors in the 
original topographic data, data transformations and interpolations. One of the factors 
determining the accuracy of the topographic data is the photo scale of the verticals, a 
larger scale (lower flying height) giving a smaller standard error. Another important 
factor is the accuracy of the geodetic reference network. The quality of the aerial 
photos used is also crucial and especially the characteristics of the snow surface. 
Constructing contour lines over snow areas is always difficult due to the poor 
contrast, and the accuracy will be lower in those areas. Digitising analogue maps 
introduces horizontal random errors due to the accuracy of the digitiser and the 
condition of the analogue manuscript. GIS calculations introduce errors when 
converting data from local coordinate systems, generating DTMs and in the overlay 
operations.

16.2 Hardangerjøkulen 
Hardangerjøkulen (61 °30'N, 7°30'E) is the sixth largest (73 km2) glacier in Norway 
and covers the aItitudinal range between 1020 and 1865 m a.s.1. The glacier is on the 
main water divide between Hardangerfjorden and Hallingdal. Mass balance has been 
measured since 1963 on the southwestern part of the glacier, called Rembesdalskåka 
(17 km2) (chapter 7) . 
Data material 
Maps covering Hardangerjøkulen have been made from photographs taken on 31 st 
August 1961 (Fjellanger Widerøe AS, contract 1230, scale 1:20000) and 31 st August 
1995 (Fjellanger Widerøe AS, contract 1 1862, scale 1:40000). The 1961-map was 
constructed analogously at scale 1 :20000 with 10 metres contour lines. The map has 
been digitised and transforrned into EUREF89 by NVE. The 1995-map was 
constructed analogously with a digital encoder at a scale of 1:50000 with 20 metre 
contour lines. The maps were constructed using different sets of ground control 
points. A comparison of point e levations did not reveal any systematic differences 
between the two maps. The uncertainty in the volurne change is estimated as ±2 m 
water equi valent.

101 
Results 
Hardangerjøkulen was divided into thirteen drainage areas based on surface 
topography and drainage divides outside the glacier (Fig. 16-1). Comparison ofthe 
glacier outlines from 1961 and 1995 show that all the outlet glaciers have retreated. 
The most significant retreat took place at Vestra Leirbottskåka (4) and 
Ramnabergbreen (lO) which both receded approximately 400 metres. The total area 
of Hardangerjøkulen was reduced from 75.0 to 72.4 km2 . 
The volume change between 1961 and 1995 in metres water equivalent is shown in 
Figure 16-1. Isdalskåka (5) and Ramnabergbreen (10) experienced a lowering of more 
than 25 metres and 45 metres, respectively. Specific volurne change in each drainage 
area is listed in table 16-1. The largest growth has been at Rembesdalskåka (8) and 
Blåisen (13), while Ramnabergbreen (lO) had the largest mass deficit. The total 
volurne increase at Hardangerjøkulen is calculated to 80 mill. m} water corresponding 
to a water layer of I.l meter. At Rembesdalskåka (8) the ca1culated volurne change of 
7 m water equivalents is in good agreement with mass balance measurements 
between 1962 and 1995 which gave a cumulative net balanee of 7.5 m water 
equivalents.

16.3 Tverråbreen 
Tverråbreen (61 °36'N, 8° 18'E) is a small valley glacier in central Jotunheimen (Fig. 
9-1). The glacier is about 3.6 km long, covers an area of 5.4 km2 and ranges in altitude 
from 1460 to 2215 m a.s.!. (Fig. 16-2). Since 1927 the glacier has retreated 1.0 km, 
and its area has been reduced by nearly 20 % (Fig. 16-2). Dybwadskog measured 
mass balance for two years from 1962 to 1963. The mean winter, summer and net 
balance figures are presented in Appendix C. 
Data material 
Tverråbreen has been mapped severaI times during the period 1927-1997 (Table 16-
2). The early surveys in the 1920s, 1930s and I 940s are described in Koller et.al. 
(1962) and Liestøi (1962). Here we concentrate on the detailed maps from 1968 and 
1997.

Detailed maps constructed of Tverråbreen. 
Data proeessing 
First, the analogue glacier maps from 1968 were digitised. A regular grid was created 
from the contour map. The 1997 map was constructed directly as a DTM and 
converted to a regular grid. Vol urne change was then ca1culated by extracting grids 
and converting to water equivalents as described in section 16.1. 
Volume change 1968-1997 
Between 27th August 1968 and 8th August 1997 Tverråbreen had a total mass loss of 
28 x 106 m3 w .eqv. or a specific mass loss of - 4.9 m w .eqv. (Fig. 16-3). The change 
in mass varied between +23 and - 52 m w.eqv. However, the se extreme values are 
unusual; nearly 90% of the glacier experienced a mass change between -10 and +5 
w.eqv. 85 % of the glacier had a negative change. The large st losses occurred on the 
glacier tongue. There is no ablation data at Tverråbreen in 1968 or 1997, but from 
Hellstugubreen we know that there was additional ablation of 1.5 m w.eqv. after 8th of 
August 1997. Tverråbreen had 60 % higher ablation than Hellstugubreen during the 
two years of mass balance measurements on Hellstugubreen. We therefore assurne 
that the average net mass change on Tverråbreen must be reduces by about 2.0 m 
w .eqv. Thus, the net result for the period 1968 to 1997 is -6.9 m. w .eqv. with an 
103 
estimated uncertainty of ±2.0 m.weqv. The mean specific value per year is -0.23 m 
w.eqv.

16.4 Hellstugubreen 
Hellstugubreen (61 Q34'N, 8Q 26'E) is a north-facing valley glacier situated in central 
Jotunheimen (Fig. 9-1). It ranges in elevation between 1480 and 2210 m a.s.l. and has 
an area of 3.0 km2 (Fig. 10-1). Mass balance investigations have been performed 
since 1962 and are described in chapter 10. 
Data material 
Hellstugubreen has been mapped in detail severaI times. The early surveys in the 
1920s, 1930s and 1940s are described in Koller et.al. (1962) and LiestøI (1962). Here 
we concentrate on the last three detailed maps from 1968, 1980 and 1997 (Table 16-
3). The 1968 and 1997-map were both constructed from vertical aerial photographs. 
The verticals taken in 1997 were scanned and constructed directly as a digital terrain 
model (DTM). A contour map was extracted from the DTM for illustrative purposes.

Detailed maps constructed of Hellstugubreen. 
Data proeessing 
The analogue glacier maps were digitised and regular grids were created from the 
contour maps. Volurne change was then calculated by extracting grids and converting 
to water equivalent as described in section 16.1. 
Results 
Vo/ume change 1968-80 
For the first period, 1968-80, Hellstugubreen had a specific net loss of -5.8 m w.eqv. 
or, expressed in vol urne, a loss of 18 x ]06 m3 (Fig. 16-4). The largest thinning 
occurred at the glacier tongue, while the uppermost palts of the glacier slightly 
thickened. Nearly 90 % of the glacier thinned, while the remaining 10 % gained mass 
during this period. 
Vo/ume change 1980-97 
For the sec ond period, 1980-97, we see a different picture (Fig. 16-4). Hellstugubreen 
had aminor specific mass loss of -0.5 m w.eqv. The glacier tongue underwent further 
thinning, but the upper parts of the glacier thickened. The verticals were taken on 8th 
105 
August, and we know from ablation records that the glacier had additional melting of 
about -1 .5 m w.eqv. over the rest of the ablation season. The 1980 verticals were 
taken so late that we assume no further melting after the time of photography that 
year. Tims, adjusting the DTM result for this difference in additional melt, the 
specific net balance of Hellstugubreen is roughly -2.0 m.w eqv. This is in fairly good 
agreement with the measured cumulative net balance for this period, -3.5 m w.eqv. 
The uncertainty of the result is assumed to be ±2.0 m w.eqv .

16.5 Gråsubreen 
Gråsubreen (61 °39' N, 8°37'E) is located in the eastern part of Jotunheimen in 
southern Norway (Fig. 9-1). The glacier covers an area of 2.2 km2 and ranges from 
1830 to 2290 m a.s. l. (Fig. Il-l) . Gråsubreen is a polythermal glacier. Mass balance 
investigations have been performed there since 1962 and are described in chapter Il . 
A new digital terrain model of the glacier in 1997 has recently been constructed, and 
is compared with the map from 1984. 
106 
Data material 
Gråsubreen has been mapped in detail three times, 1968, 1984 and 1997 (Table 16-4). 
The first two maps were constructed by analogue photogrammetry from vertical aerial 
photographs. They were produced at a scale of 1: 10,000 with a 10-m contour 
interval. The vol urne change of Gråsubreen for the period 1968 - 1984 has previously 
been calculated manually and is described in Haakensen (1986). The 1968 map was 
found to be inaccurate. The accuracy of the 1984 map is considered to be very good 
due to a detailed field survey in connection with the mapping. The 1997 map was 
constructed directly as a digital terrain model from scanned aerial photographs. A 
contour map was extracted for illustrative purposes.

Data proeessing 
The analogue glaeier map from 1984 was digitised and a regular grid was created 
from the contour map. The 1997 DTM was converted to a regular grid and used 
directly in the analysis. Volurne change was calculated by extracting grids and 
converting to water equivalent as described in section 16.1. 
Results 
Volurne change 1984-97 
From 23th August 1984 to 8th August 1997 Gråsubreen had a specific mass loss of 
-0.30 m w.eqv. or a total volume loss of -0.67 106 m3. The estimated uncertainty is 
±1 m w.eqv. The change in mass varied between +7.1 and -7.7 m w.eqv. Nearly 80 % 
of the glaeier had a specific change between -3 and +3 m w.eqv. 61 % of the glacier 
had a negative change in mass balance, while the rest of the glaeier had a positive 
change. When adjusting for the -1.2 m w.eqv. that is the difference in additional 
melting from the data of photography to the end of the melt season, the specific net 
result is -1.5 m w .eqv. U sing this adjustment, nearly 80 % of the glaeier had a 
negative change between the end of the melt season in 1984 and 1997. 
The cumulative net balanee measured in this period is -1.9 m w.eqv. Thus, there is 
very good agreement between the specific volurne change calculated from maps and 
DTMs, and the measured net balanee at Gråsubreen for the period 1984-1997.

16.6 Høgtuvbreen 
Høgtuvbreen is a glaeier complex south of Svartisen. A mass balanee program was 
carried out in the 1970s on part of northern Høgtuvbreen (66°27' N , 13°40' E). This 
east-faced outlet is a typical valley glaeier and has a length of about 2.0 km and an 
area of 2.0 km2 (1998). Mass balanee investigations began in 1971 and measurements 
were carried out annua lly until 1977. 
Data material 
A detailed map of this part of Høgtuvbreen was made from vertical aerial 
photographs in 1972 (Tab. 16-5). This map was considered to have a low accuracy 
due to the inaccurate triangulation network existing at the time of mapping (1972-73). 
Therefore, a new digital terrain model from the 1972-verticals was constructed in 
2000 together with the digital terrain model from the 1998-verticals. Both DTMs 
were produced from scanned vertical photographs using digital photogrammetry.

Data proeessing 
The new 1972 DTM and the 1998 DTM were converted to regu lar grids and used 
directly in the analysis . Volurne change was then calculated by extracting grids and 
converting to water equi valents as described in section 16. I . 
Results 
Between 29th July 1972 and l st September 1998 Høgtuvbreen had a specific net loss 
of -7.3 m w.eqv. or, expressed in volurne, a loss of -14 x L06 m3 (Fig. 16-6). The 
uncertainty of the result is ±2.0 m w.eqv. The largest mass loss was at the glaeier 
tongue, whi le a thickening occurred in the accumu lation area. More than 50 % of the 
glacier lost volurne, while the remainder increased in volurne. During this period the 
glacier lost nearly 20 % of its area and had a 25 % reduction in length. The glacier 
retreated more than 700 metres from 1972 to 1998, or about 27 meters annually. 
The mass balance records of Høgtuvbreen are well correlated with those of 
Engabreen (r2=0.87). Engabreen has a long record of mass balance observations 
(1970-2001) . Using this correlation we can estimate the cumulative net balance at 
Høgtuvbreen for the period 1972-1998. The estimated cumulative net balance was 
-8.2 m w .eqv. between 1972 and 1998. The result from the DTM-comparison 
adjusted for the additional mel ting that occurred after the time of photography is -6.3 
m w.eqv. (-7.3 +1 m w.eqv.). Thus, the results are fairly consistent taking the 
uncertainties in both methods into account.

16.7 Strupbreen and Koppangsbreen 
The glaeier complex Strupbreen and Koppangsbreen (69° 42'N, 20° lOE) is the largest 
continuous ice mass on the Lyngen peninsuela (Fig. 16-7), and covers a total area of 
13.2 km2• Stupbreen comprises about two thirds of this area, while Koppangsbreen 
covers about one third. The glacier complex ranges in altitude from about 440 (the 
snout of Strubreen) and 460 m a.s.l. (the snout of Koppangsbreen) to about 1350 m 
a.s.l. There have been no mass balanee studies on these glaeiers, although a number 
of other investigations have been performed (Whalley and KjølImoen, 20(0). 
Data material 
There exist three detailed maps/DTMs covering the whole glacier complex 
(Tab. 16-6). High-quality vertical aerial photographs taken in August 1985 were used 
to construet a detail ed map of the glacier complex. Aerial photographs of the glacier 
in 1978 and 1952 were used to construet two other glacier maps. The 1952-map 
covers only the lower parts of Strupbreen. These maps were printed together in 1985. 
New verticals were taken in 1998. These verticals were scanned and a digital terrain 
model was constructed using digital photogrammetry.

Data proeessing 
The analogue glaeier maps from 1978 and 1985 were digitised, then regular grids 
were created from the contour maps. The 1998 DTM was converted to a regular grid 
and used directly in the analysis. Vol urne change was calculated by extracting grids 
and converting to water equivalents as described in section 16.1. The estimated 
uncertainty of the result is roughly ±2.0 m w.eqv. for the period 1978-85 and 
± 1.5 w .eqv. for the period 1985-98. 
Results 
Vo/ume change 1978-85 
Between 21 st J uly 1978 and 21 st August 1985 the glacier complex 
StrupbreenlKoppangsbreen had a specific mass loss of -6.1 m w.eqv. or a volume loss 
of 80 106 m' (Fig. 16-8). Almost all the glaeier (95 %) had a mass loss during this 
eight -year period. The glaeier area was smaller in 1978 (12.6 km2) than in 1985 
110 
(13.1 km\ but this is explained as being due to more snow patches/glacier tributaries 
in the upper accumulation area being included in the 1985-outline. The glacier front 
of Strupbreen retreated about 30-40 meters from 1978 to 1985, whi1e the glacier front 
of Koppangsbreen retreated about 100 meters.

For the second period, 1985-98, Strupbreen and Koppangsbreen had aminor specific 
mass loss of -0.8 m w.egv or a volume loss of 11 lOG ml (Fig. 16-9). Generally, the 
lower pmi of the glaeier complex (below 840 m a.s.l. at Strupbreen and below 780 m 
a.s.l. at Koppangsbreen) lost volume. In contrast, the upper parts of the glaeier have 
increased their vo1ume. OveralL there was volume loss from 55 % of the glaeier. 
Nearly 80 % of the glacier had speeifie mass change between -10 and + 5 m w.egv. 
The total area of the glaeier complex was unchangcd between 1985 and 1998 and the 
glaeier [roIltS were almost the same in 1998 as in 1985.

17 Glaeier monitoring (Hallgeir Elvehøy) 
17.1 Front position change 
In 2000 front position change was measured for 24 glaciers, 20 in southem Norway 
and four in northem Norway (Fig. 17-1). 
~~gfjord-
~økelen 
Figure 17-1 
Location map showing glaciers where front position measurements were performed in 2000, and 
described in this chapter. Notice that the different glacier areas are not to scale. 
Methods 
The distance is measured from one or severai established caims or painted marks on 
rocks to the glacier front in defined directions, normally in September or October 
each year. Change in distance gives a rough estimate of the front fluctuations at one 
or more points at the glacier fronts. These measurements have a fairly high degree of 
uncertainty both in the actuallength determination, and to what extent the 
measurement is representative for the entire glaeier front. The measurements give, 
nevertheless, valuable information about glaeier fluctuations and regional tendeneies 
and variations when longer time periods are considered. Observations of front 
position change have been made for Norwegian glaeiers since the 1880s, but 
continuous measurements started around 1900.

Results 
The front position change from 1999 to 2000 is shown in Table 17-1 . At 
Jostedalsbreen ten outlets were measured. Two glaciers have had marked advances, 
while two glaciers have retreated considerably. Nigardsbreen has advanced 23 metres 
since last year and 253 metres in 10 years. Fåbergstøisbreen advanced 25 metres last 
year and 190 metres since 1992. Briksdalsbreen retreated 30 metres, the largest 
annual retreat since 1951 when the last major recession ended at the head of lake 
Briksdalsvatnet. The lake was completely covered by the glacier at the termination of 
the last advance in 1996. Store Supphellebre is a regenerated glacier where front 
position change varies a lot from year to year due to avalanche activity. Last year the 
glacier advanced 24 metres. This year it has retreated 46 metres. The rest of the 
glaciers have had small changes in their front positions.

Front position change between autumn 1999 and autumn 2000 for 24 glaeiers in Norway. 
At Folgefonna the outlet Bondhusbrea has retreated 24 metres, and 54 metres since 
measurements began in 1996. Botnabrea advanced 6 metres over the last year, and 28 
metres since 1996. Buerbreen was stable last year, but has retreated 15 metres since 
1996. 
114 
Rembesdalskåka, the largest outlet from Hardangerjøkulen, advanced 21 metres 
compensating for previous year's recession of 20 metres. These fluctuations are 
caused by the glaeier outlet river exiting the terminus close to the line of 
measurement. The northern outlet Midtdalsbreen showed a net advance of 8 metres. 
In Jotunheimen Leirbreen is still retreating, causing the area of Lake Leirtjømin to 
increase. Storgjuvbreen advanced 6 metres, and has been advancing approximately 6 
metres per year since measurements began in 1997. The other glaeiers in Jotunheimen 
had minor changes. Storbreen could not be measured due to a snowdrift covering the 
terminus in the line of measurement. 
The only investigated outlet from Svartisen, Engabreen, had only a small change in its 
front position from 1999 to 2000. The three northernmost glaeiers in Lyngen and 
Finnmark are retreating but at a slower rate than last year.

18 H istorical notes: Kjøl breen 
and Glombreen 1953-56 
(Espen Gudevang and Hallgeir Elvehøy) 
18.1 Background 
Kjølbreen (66°40'N, 14°0S'E) is a small , east-facing outlet glacier from the West 
Svartisen ice cap. Glombreen (66°S1'N, l3°S7'E) is a small glaciated area (7.8 km2, 
1968) surrounding the mountain Istinden IS km north of the West Svartisen ice cap. 
Mass balance investigations were initiated in 19S3 at these two glaciers by 
glaciologist Olav Liestøi of the Norwegian Polar Institute. The purpose of the 
investigations was to assess glacier impact on discharge measured in rlvers and the 
calculated inflow to reservoirs. The measurements were made over three years, but 
the resul ts have not been published before.

Kjølbreen 
Kjølbreen drains naturally to Kjølvatnet (705 m a.s.l.) and Terskaldvatnet, and further 
to Glomåga in Rana. This catchment has been artificially diverted to Storglomvatnet. 
The glacier terminus was mapped in 1910, 1937 and 1945 revealing a considerable 
retreat of the glacier and a corresponding enlargement of lake Kjølvatnet. A detailed 
map was constructed from terrestrial photos from 1953 and a reference point network. 
Observations from field workers showed that the lower part of Kjølbreen below 875 
m a.s.l. was then in a state of general decay. Therefore, these investigations were 
concentrated on the upper part of the glacier. 
Based on the topographic map from 1953 drainage divides for the glacier were 
defined, and the area-altitude distribution was calculated. The glacier area was 
3.9 km2, and the glacier covered the altitudinal interval between 875 and 1225 m a.s.l. 
Glombreen 
The investigations at Glombreen were carried out on the parts of the glacier draining 
towards Øvre Glomvatn, which is a water reservoir to a Norsk Hydro factory in 
Glomfjord. The area of the investigated part of Glombreen was approximately 2 km2 
covering the altitudinal interval between 780 and 1075 m a.s.l. 
18.2 Methods and results 
Kjøl breen 
The field workers plotted the snow depth observations on the 1953 map. The point 
measurements were plotted against altitude, and an altitudinal winter balance curve 
was fitted to the point measurements. From this curve and the altitudinal area 
distribution the specific winter balance was calculated. In addition, the observations 
of snow depth water equivalents were digitised, winter balance maps were 
constructed by interpolation between the point measurements, and mean winter 
balance was calculated from the winter balance maps. The net balance was calculated 
as an average of the net balance at stake positions. The summer balance is calculated 
from the winter and net balance. The results from the individual years are given 
below, and also listed in Table 18-1. 
1953-54 
The winter balance was calculated from 93 soundings of snow depth taken between 
900 and 1190 m a.s.l. in May 1954. From density measurements the mean density of 
the snow pack was calculated to be 0.45 g/cm3• The winter balance was calculated as 
1.9 m w.eqv. from both an altitudinal distribution curve and a winter balance map. 
Calculations of net balance for 1953-54 are based on stake measurements taken on 
19th September 1953 and 31 st August 1954. Unfortunately, all of the stakes except two 
had melted out when measurements were taken on 31 st August. These two stakes at 
1100 and 1190 m a.s.l. showed a slightly negative net balance (-0.4 and -0.3 m 
w.eqv., respectively). 
117 
1954-55 
The winter balance was calculated from 32 soundings of snow depth between 920 and 
1170 m a.s.l. taken in May 1955. From density measurements the mean density of the 
snow pack was calculated to be 0.47 g/cm3• The winter balance was calculated as 
2.1 m w.eqv. from an altitudinal distribution curve and as 1.9 m w.eqv. from a winter 
balance map. 
Calculations of net balanee for 1954-55 are based on stake measurements taken on 
31 st August 1954 and 20th September 1955. The net balanee was calculated for eight 
stake positions between 1000 and 1190 m a.sl., and was between -0.3 and -1.2 m 
w.eqv with a mean value of -0.73 m w.eqv. The net balance at the two stakes used for 
1953-54 showed -0.3 and -0.4 m w.eqv. 
1955-56 
The winter balance was calculated from 35 soundings of snow depth between 940 and 
1170 m a.s.l. taken on 5th April 1956. From density measurements the mean density 
of the snow pack was calculated to be 0.43 glcm3• The winter balance was ca1culated 
as 1.1 m w.eqv. from an altitudinal distribution curve and to be 1.0 m w.eqv. from a 
winter balance map. 
Ca1culations of net balanee in 1955-56 are based on stake measurements taken on 20th 
September 1955 and 14th August 1956. The net balance was ca1culated for ten stake 
positions between 1030 and 1190 m a.sl., and was between -0.3 and +0.5 m w.eqv. 
with a mean value of 0.16 m w .eqv. The net balanee at the two stakes used for 1953-
54 showed +0.8 and +0.2 m w.eqv. There was no altitudinal trend in the stake net 
balanee values. Since net balance measurements were taken as early as mid-August 
there was probably some melting after 14th August 1956. At the meteorological 
station in Glomfjord the average monthly temperatures in August and September 
1956 were 1.0 and 1.2 below the 1931-60 mean monthly temperature. Therefore, the 
actual annual net balanee was probably slightly more negative than the measurements 
show, and we estimate the net balance to be 0.0 m w.eqv.

Glombreen 
The field workers plotted observations on sketeh maps without further information on 
loeation and altitude. The winter balanee was ealculated as an average of the 
soundings. Olav LiestøI ealculated the net balanee from the stake measurements 
supplemented by eonsiderations of meteorologieal data from Glomfjord and 
measurements at Kjølbreen. The summer balanee is ealculated from the winter and 
net balanees. The results from the individual years are given be10w, and the results 
are listed in Tab1e lS-2. 
1953-54 
The winter balanee was ealculated from 31 soundings of snow depth taken on 10th 
May 1954. From density measurements the mean density of the snow paek was 
ealculated to be 0.50 g/em3 . Mean snow depth was 4.6 m eorresponding to a winter 
balanee of 2.3 m w.eqv. 
Calcu1ations ofnet balanee in 1953-54 are based on stake measurements taken on 
29th September and 3rd November 1953, and l st August 1954. Unfortunately, all of the 
stakes melted out between l st August and Sth September 1954. By 16th September all 
the winter snow had melted away. Olav Liestøl ealculated the net balanee to 
-1.2 m w.eqv. 
1954-55 
The winter balanee was ealculated from 14 soundings of snow depth taken on 13th 
May 1955. From density measurements the mean dens it y of the snow paek was 
ea1culated to be 0.42 g/em3• Mean snow depth was 6.2 m eorresponding to a winter 
balanee of 2.6 m w.eqv. 
Calcu1ations of net balanee in 1954-55 are based on measurements at 5 stake 
positions taken on 16th September 1954 and 14th September 1955. Snow from last 
winter remained at the uppermost stakes. Olav LiestøI ealculated the net balanee to be 
-0.1 m w.eqv.

1955-56 
The winter balance was ca1culated from 18 soundings of snow depth taken on 9th 
April 1956. From dens it y measurements the mean dens it y of the snow pack was 
calculated to be 0.45 glem'. Mean snow depth was 3.4 m corresponding to a winter 
balance of 1.5 m w.eqv. 
Calculations ofnet balance for 1955-56 are based on stake measurements taken on 
14th September 1955 and 8th September 1956. Snow from last winter remained at all 
except the lowermost stakes. Olav Liestøi calculated the net balance to be 
-0.6 m w.eqv. 
18.3 Discussion 
Data quality 
The mass balance programs at Kjølbreen and Glombreen suffered from severai 
problems resulting in poor data quality. The stake measurements were not continuous 
partly due to wooden stakes failing to withstand winter conditions, and partly due to 
poor stake maintenance during late summer and autumn. The quality of the data 
reports is also questionable. 
Comparison with meteorological data 
In order to put these results into a wider time frarne, the meteorological record for 
temperature and preeipitation from Glomfjord in 1953-56 has been compared to the 
meteorological standard periods 1931-60 and 1961-90. The winter preeipitation 
(October-May) and summer temperature (June-September) in Glomfjord are used as 
proxies for winter and summer balances on the glaciers (Tab. 18-3). 
The meteorological data indicate that winter 1953-54 was wetter than normal, while 
1955 and 1956 had cooler than normal summers. The mass balance results do not 
show this dearly. The higher mass balanee values at Glombreen than at Kjølbreen 
reflect that Glombreen is at a lower elevation and doser to the sea than Kjølbreen.

Mass balanee measurements in Norway - annual 
results 
There are results from 473 years of measurements at Norwegian glaciers. The 
following tables show winter (bw), summer (bs) and net balanee (bn) together with 
eumulative net balanee (eum. bn) and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) for every single 
year at eaeh glacier. In front of eaeh table there is a heading eontaining the name and 
the area of the glaeier. The reported year (in braekets) eorresponds to the given area.
