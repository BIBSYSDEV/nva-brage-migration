[MULTIPLE_DESCRIPTION_PRESENT = [This product contains transient glacier snowlines and zones as described in the Copernicus Glacier Service report (Andreassen et al., 2021). Snowlines were manually digitized or derived using thresholds of band 8. Pixel values in the band 8 (NIR) of Sentinel-2 were inspected to find the best threshold for differentiating between snow, ice and possibly firn. Due to varying terrain and atmospheric conditions, range of values of snow, firn and ice was found to vary even within a single scene and therefore manual corrections were often necessary., Dette datasettet er et bidrag til Copernicus Bretjeneste – This dataset is a contribution to Copernicus Glacier Service]] Bundle location: 2828121/8, Handle: https://hdl.handle.net/11250/2828409
